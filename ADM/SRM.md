## Single Pilot Resource Management (SRM)
- Single-Pilot Resource Management (SRM) is the subset of Aeronautical Decision Making (ADM) that includes how to gather information, analyze it, and make decisions.
- There is no one right answer in ADM, rather each pilot is expected to analyze each situation in light of experience level, personal minimums, and current physical and mental readiness level, and make his or her own decision

### 5 P's Method (5 P's Check)
- To be implemented at (_at least_ these) predefined critical phases of flight: 
    - **Preflight** 
    - **Before Takeoff** 
    - **Hourly and Midpoint** 
    - **Pre Descent** 
    - **Prior to Final Approach** 
    - **In emergencies**
- Most pilots execute approaches with the expectation that they will land out of the approach every time. _**A healthier approach requires the pilot to assume that changing conditions (the 5 Ps again) will cause the pilot to divert or execute the missed approach on every approach.**_
- Based on belief that the pilot _**have essentially 5 variables that impact their environment that lead up to critical decisions being made**_:
#### Plan: 
- The **Plan** can also be called the _**mission**_ or the _**task**_. It contains the basic elements of cross-country planning, weather, route, fuel, publications currency, etc. The **Plan** should be reviewed and updated several times during the course of the flight.
- However the **Plan** is not just about the flight plan, as the other 4 variables will constantly dictate potential and real changes to the flight plan. A delayed departure which snowballs a fast-moving weather system into the originally planned route, a sudden TFR in the route, etc, etc all dictate real-life _**dynamic**_ changes to the plan to complete the mission. 
- If for no other reason, the 5-P check reminds the pilot _that the day’s flight **plan** is real life and subject to change at any time._
#### Plane: 
- The “plane” consists of the usual array of mechanical and flight-supporting equipment. Like the plane possessing a Garmin 530 GNS IFR-Communication/Navigation system, and it's readiness and currency (database currency, etc) to fly in expected IMC conditions. 
- A good example of how you view _decisions_ through this P: Does the aircraft have an autopilot system? If the flight is expected to be in IFR conditions, this decision 'matrix' could make a large impact on the overall decision to continue the flight, especially in the flight planning and pre-takeoff stages.
- Consider emergency backup systems (electrical system, navigation backups like a handheld Nav/Com).
#### Pilot: 
- Always regularly consult the [IMSAFE](./IMSAFE.md) checklist during this portion of the 5-P check.
- Factors like Fatigue, Altitude, Sensory Overload in a high density traffic area and with a plane equipped with newer unfamiliar equipment, etc can all influence the Pilot at all of the stages of decision making. 
- A great example of how to make pre-flight and pre-takeoff decisions based on this P, especially in the flight-planning stage, is to consider your flight plan is 4 hours, at night, with IFR conditions forecast at the destination. Consider the very real lowering of guard, succeptibility to small mistakes, etc that will be present on the night, instrument approach portion of that plan. 
#### Passengers:
- The needs and desires of the passengers, especially in SRM (as opposed to CRM where you likely have a dedicated co-pilot or even flight attendant that can directly interact with the passengers) will enter the decision making loop for the Pilot. 
- Be aware of their 'get-there-itis', physiological needs, etc. 
- A clever way of giving yourself an out, lets say with Low-IFR expected at the destination airport, is to plan for a rental car pickup at a fuel-stop airport close to , but not in the IMC conditions forecasted at the destination. 
- There have also been catastrophic events where there may be more than 1 pilot in the plane. Having other pilot-rated passengers, with no clear and certain PIC designated can lead to all kinds of confusion, mayhem, and conflicting decisions. 
- Also, explain any expected risks like IMC with the passengers, explain alternatives for them (like buying an airline ticket, or renting a car), then listen to their intentions which may very well be to not continue the planned flight, thereby completely removing the pressure from you the pilot. 
#### Programming: 
- The advanced avionics aircraft adds an entirely new dimension to the way GA aircraft are flown. The electronic instrument displays, GPS, and autopilot reduce pilot workload and increase pilot situational awareness.
- The pilot must make sure they're familiar with the operation of these advanced avionics.
- The pilot must also determine and stick-to pre-planned points in the flight at which to enter the flight plan, enter and select the correct approach, etc, _**and not be constantly distracted by them.**_
- The pilot should also consider what his or her capabilities are in response to last minute changes of the approach (and the reprogramming required) and ability to make large-scale changes (a reroute for instance) while hand flying the aircraft.
- Since formats are not standardized, simply moving from one manufacturer’s equipment to another should give the pilot pause and require more conservative planning and decisions.

### 3 P's Method (3P) - Perceive, Process, Perform
- The Perceive, Process, Perform (3P) model for ADM offers a simple, practical, and systematic approach that can be used during all phases of flight.
- **Perceive** the given set of circumstances for a flight
- **Process** by evaluating their impact on flight safety
- **Perform** by implementing the best course of action
- Use the Perceive, Process, Perform, and Evaluate method as a continuous model for **every aeronautical decision that you make**.
#### Perceive:
- Pilots can help **Perceive** hazards by using the [PAVE](./PAVE.md) checklist of: Pilot, Aircraft, enVironment, and External pressures.
- In the first step, the goal is to develop situational awareness by perceiving hazards, which are present events, objects, or circumstances that could contribute to an undesired future event.
- Ask _"What could hurt me, my passengers, or my aircraft?"_
#### Process: 
- Pilots can **Process** hazards by using the **CARE** checklist of: **Consequences**, **Alternatives**, **Reality**, **External** factors.
- In the second step, the goal is to process this information to determine whether the identified hazards constitute <u>**risk**</u>, _**which is defined as the future impact of a hazard that is not controlled or eliminated**_
- So for each hazard identified in step 1, run the CARE checklist of: Consequences, Alternatives, Reality, External factors.
- As an example of **CARE** lets assume a night flight scenario: 
    - **Consequences**: Departing after a full workday creates fatigue and pressure
    - **Alternatives**: Delay until morning; Reschedule meeting; Drive
    - **Reality**: Dangers and distractions of fatigue could lead to an accident
    - **External Pressures**: business meeting at destination might influence me
#### Perform:
- Pilots can **Perform** risk management by using the **TEAM** choice list of: **Transfer**, **Eliminate**, **Accept**, or **Mitigate**.
