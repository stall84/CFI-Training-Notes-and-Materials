## PAVE Hazard/Risk Checklist
- Used to categorize flight hazards and their related risk.
### P - Pilot In Command (PIC)
- Experience, Recency, and Currency [(FAR Part 61, etc)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-61/subpart-A/section-61.57) factors. Ask _'Am I legal to fly?'_
- To the above _'legal'_ readiness, apply the [IMSAFE checklist](./IMSAFE.md) for the PIC for physical, mental/emotional risk assessment.
### A - Aircraft
- Determine what limitations will the aircraft impose upon the trip. Is it the correct aircraft for the trip? Are you capable of operating it safely?
- Are the required instruments installed and operable for the type of flight planned? [(FAR 91.205)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-C/section-91.205)
- In this category include all of your preflight planning calculations like: **Required Fuel**, **Runway Available (TO/LDG)**, **Weight&Balance**, **Oxygen(if altituded planned reqs it)**, etc.
