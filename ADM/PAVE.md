## PAVE Hazard/Risk Checklist
- Used to categorize flight hazards and their related risk.
### P - Pilot In Command (PIC)
- Experience, Recency, and Currency [(FAR Part 61, etc)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-61/subpart-A/section-61.57) factors. Ask _'Am I legal to fly?'_
- To the above _'legal'_ readiness, apply the [IMSAFE checklist](./IMSAFE.md) for the PIC for physical, mental/emotional risk assessment.
### A - Aircraft
- Determine what limitations will the aircraft impose upon the trip. Is it the correct aircraft for the trip? Are you capable of operating it safely?
- Are the required instruments installed and operable for the type of flight planned? [(FAR 91.205)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-91/subpart-C/section-91.205)
- In this category include all of your preflight planning calculations like: **Required Fuel**, **Runway Available (TO/LDG)**, **Weight&Balance**, **Oxygen(if altituded planned reqs it)**, etc.
### V - EnVironment (Contains Several Sub-Sections)
#### Weather
- **Weather**, **Weather**, **Weather**.. And more weather.
- We know that weather is a huge factor in many fatal general aviation accidents, but it's important to not get complacent and always be fully aware of the current and future weather forecasts and general weather pattern knowledge. 
- Current **ceilings** and **visibility**
- Forecast **ceilings** and **visibility**
- Is the flight into mountainous or unfamiliar terrains ? If so consider raising your _personal minima_ for ceiling and visibility to account for the unfamiliarity with the terrain.
- Mountains can produce a whole slew of dangerous turbulent-wind and weather phenomena, be aware and be ready to mitigage.
- **Icing:** _'Is Icing forecast for the route of the flight?'_. If so, is the pilot familiar with and competent in operating the aircraft's deicing equipment? 
#### Terrain
- Evaluate the dangers varying terrain can cause for the route of flight.
- Consult VFR Sectional charts, use Maximum Elevation Figures, etc. Combine knowledge and dangers of mountainous terrain. 
#### Airspace
- Be aware of any TFR's or MOA / Restricted airspace(s) that are to be encountered on the route of flight and nearby, check MOA operating times, altitudes, and contact frequencies.
- If the flight is over remote areas or large bodies of water, make sure the correct survival equipment is on the aircraft.
#### Nighttime
- Significantly more accidents occur at night due to the nature of reduced ground reference capability. Make sure pilot is capable of using instruments should they lose reference with the ground (in VFR flight), and make sure all fuel requirements are met for night flying (VFR or IFR) [(45min fuel reserve beyond the intended destination airport for VFR Night flight)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/14/91.151), [(45min fuel reserve for IFR Night flight **beyond the alternate airport**)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/14/91.167)
### E - External Pressures
- External pressures are influences external to the flight that create a sense of pressure to complete a flight.
- An important client/passenger that does not want to be dissapointed
- A financial desire to complete a charter flight
- A pilot's general goal-oriented attitude or "gumption" leading to a forced flight when other risk factors might not be conducive. 
- All of these might be capable of being mitigated during the full analysis of the risk involved, but often these External pressures, especially financial ones, are incorrectly assesed and evaluated and can lead to catastrophic consequences.
#### Outweighted Negative Influence of External Pressures
- Management of external pressure is the single most important key to risk management because it is the one risk factor category that can cause a pilot to ignore all the other risk factors.
- External pressures put time-related pressure on the pilot and figure into a majority of accidents.
- Creation and use of Personal Standard Operating Procedures (PSOP's) can provide a calculated 'escape' or 'abort' mode to pilot's when encountering the sometimes enormous external pressures. 
- A PSOP might include options like: A backup mode of transportation if any of the other risk factors become to great. A refund and/or guarantee mechanism, along with a detailed explanation (to the passenger/client) of the reasons the flight cannot be performed. Carrying an overnight pack/bag to reduce pressure to get back home after a long day of flying.
