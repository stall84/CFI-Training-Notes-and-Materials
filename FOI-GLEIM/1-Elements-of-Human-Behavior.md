### Understanding Human Behavior 
1) Essential to grasping patterns behind human actions and decision making.
    - Human behavior is the product of factors that cause people to _act_ in predictable ways.
    - Behavior is influenced by _factors_ and componsed of _elements_
    - Elements include:
        - **Innate Human Nature**: Biological and Psychological predisposition
        - **Individual Experience**: Personal history and learned behaviors. Cognitive development.
        - **Environment**: Immediate surroundings and external stimuli. Social, cultural and economic influences.

2) Definitions of human behavior often involve attempts to _satisfy certain **needs**_ 
    - **Needs** may be:
        - Simple: Food, water, etc.
        - Complex: Respect, acceptance, ego-stoking
    - Human behavior is characterized by a distinct set of physical, physiological, and behavioral features.
        - Thoughts, feelings and behavior can differ radically, especially relating to age.
        - As a learner develops, that development and maturity drives the mode of action from _dependency_ to _self-direction_. Necessarily an instructor needs to offer a curriculum and environmnent that addresses the varying learner tendency to _self-direct_.
    - **Continued effort at understanding human behavior leads to succesful instruction**
