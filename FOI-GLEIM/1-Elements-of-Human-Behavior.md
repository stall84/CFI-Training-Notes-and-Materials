### Understanding Human Behavior 
1) Essential to grasping patterns behind human actions and decision making.
    - Human behavior is the product of factors that cause people to _act_ in predictable ways.
    - Behavior is influenced by _factors_ and componsed of _elements_
    - Elements include:
        - **Innate Human Nature**: Biological and Psychological predisposition
        - **Individual Experience**: Personal history and learned behaviors. Cognitive development.
        - **Environment**: Immediate surroundings and external stimuli. Social, cultural and economic influences.

2) Definitions of human behavior often involve attempts to _satisfy certain **needs**_ 
    - **Needs** may be:
        - Simple: Food, water, etc.
        - Complex: Respect, acceptance, ego-stoking
    - Human behavior is characterized by a distinct set of physical, physiological, and behavioral features.
        - Thoughts, feelings and behavior can differ radically, especially relating to age.
        - As a learner develops, that development and maturity drives the mode of action from _dependency_ to _self-direction_. Necessarily an instructor needs to offer a curriculum and environmnent that addresses the varying learner tendency to _self-direct_.
    - **Continued effort at understanding human behavior leads to succesful instruction**

3) Instructor and learner relationship integrity requires a working understanding of learner personality types
    - Insight into the individual and their unique learning style can enhance educational outcomes.
    - However there is variation in human behavior due to basic dfferences in the ways individuals prefer to use their _perception_ and _judgement_.
    - Personality type also plays a key role in how a person learns or teaches.
    - Compatibility between teaching and learning promotes:
        - Information retention
        - Effective application
        - Extensive learning
        - Positive attitude
    - Important for instructors to when necessary adapt teaching style to bridge the difference (if exists) and better match a learning style.

4) **Motivation** drives actions and behaviors, serving as the foundation for achieving goals.
    - Motivation is the _primary_ driver of a learner's progress and ability to learn. 
    - Slumps in learning are often due to declining motivation.
    - Motivations may be:
        - **Positive or Negative**
        - **Tangible or Intangible**
        - **Obvioius or Subtle and Difficult to identify**
    - **Positive Motivation**: is _essential_ to true learning, is provided by the promise or achievement of rewards, and is generally the more effective way to properly motivate learners. 
        - Such rewards may involve financial gain, satisfaction of the self-concept, personal gain, or public recognition.
        - Tangible positive motivation may include rewards that involve financial gain or public recognitio.
        - Intangible positive motivations may include the desire for personal comfort and security, group approval, and achievement of a favorable self-image.
    - **Negative Motivation**: Are those that cause a learner to react with fear and anxiety.
        - _Negative motivations in the form of criticism and threats should be avoided with all but the most overconfident and impulsive of learners_.
    - **Tangible Motivation**: Often comes in form of financial or physical rewards.
    - Learners seeking **intangible rewards** are motivated by the desire for personal comfort and security, group approval, etc. Instructors often forget this form of motivation.
    - Sources of motivation vary, _but what's important is for the instructor to to make the learner aware that a particular lesson can help with reaching an important goal_.
        - **If learners are unable to see the benefits or purpose of a lesson, they are less motivated**.
        - **Confusion, disinterest, and uneasiness on the part of the learner could happen as _a result of not knowing the objective of each period of instruction_**.
        - **If motivation is to be effective, learners must believe that their efforts will be suitably rewarded in a definite, tangible manner**.
