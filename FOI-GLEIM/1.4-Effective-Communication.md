## Effective Communication

1) Basic elements of communication are essential for effective interaction and understanding.
    - **Effective communication**: _**depends on how closely the idea transmitted by the sender matches the interpretation of the receiver.**_
        - The process of communication is composed of three dynamically interrelated elements:
            - **A Source** _(sender, speaker, or instructor)_
            - **The symbols used in composing and transmitting the message** _(e.g. words or acronyms)_
            - **The Receiver** _(listener, reader, or learner)_
        - Communication takes place when one person transmits ideas or feelings to another person or to a group of people. 
            - The effectiveness of communication is measured by the similarity between the idea transmitted and the idea received.
            - Effective communication has taken place when, and only when, the receivers react with understanding and change their behavior accordingly.
            - Instruction has taken place when a procedure has been explained and the desired learner response has occurred.
        - The effectiveness of persons acting in their role of communicators is related to at least three basic factors.
            - First, **Their ability to select symbols that are meaningful to the listener**
            - Second, **Communicators consciously or unconsciously reveal attitudes toward themselves, toward the ideas they are trying to transmit, and toward the receivers**. _Thus to communicate effectively, instructors must reveal a positive attitude while delivering their message_.
            - Third, **To be more likely to communicate effectively, communicators should speak or write from a broad background of accurate, up-to-date, and stimulating material**.
    - **Symbols** _**are oral and visual codes used to communicate**_.
        - Ideas are communicated only when symbols are combined into meaningful wholes (e.g. sentences, paragraphs, chapters, etc)
