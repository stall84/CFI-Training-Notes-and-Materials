## Effective Communication

1) Basic elements of communication are essential for effective interaction and understanding.
    - Effective communication is composed of three dynamically interrelated elements:
        - **A Source** _(sender, speaker, or instructor)_
        - **The symbols used in composing and transmitting the message** _(e.g. words or acronyms)_
        - **The Receiver** _(listener, reader, or learner)_
