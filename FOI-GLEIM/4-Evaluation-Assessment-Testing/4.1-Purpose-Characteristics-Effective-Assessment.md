## Purpose and Characteristics of Effective Assessment

1) No instructor skill **is more important than the ability to _analyze_, _appraise_, and _judge_ learner performance**
    - Assessment is an **essential** and **continuous** component of the teaching and learning process.
        - **Assessment**: Is the process of gathering measurable information to meet evaluation needs. It involves judgement by the instructor and collaboration with the learner during the evaluation stage.
        - Instructors continuously evaluate learner performance in order to provide _guidance_, _suggestions for improvement_, and _positive reinforcement_.
        - To **_enhance a learner's acceptance of further instruction_, the instructor should keep the learner informed of the progress made**
            - This will help **minimize** learner **frustrations**, which will keep the learner motivated to learn.
        - Assessment helps the instructor _see where more emphasis is needed_ and _determine the readiness of the learner to move forward_
    - In order to provide direction and increase learner performance, **assessments must be factual and must be aligned with the completion standards of the lesson**

2) An **assessment should be**:
    - **Objective**
        - An effective assessment is focused on learner performance and **should not** reflect the _personal opinions_, _likes_, _dislikes_, and _biases_ of the instructor.
        - It must be honest and **based on the performance as it was, not as it could have been**.
    - **Flexible**
        - The instructor must fit the tone, technique, and content of the critique to the occasion and the learner
        - Evaluate the entire performance in the context it was accomplished and allow for variables, whether they occur on the part of the learner or from factors outside the learner's control.
            - It should satisfy the requirements of the moment
    - **Acceptable**
        - Before learners willingly accept their instructor's assessment, **they must first willingly accept the instructor**. 
        - Learners must **have confidence** in the instructor's **qualifications**, **teaching ability**, **sincerity**, **competence**, and **authority**
            - An instructor's manner, attitude, and familiarity with the subject at hand does much to serve this purpose.
        - Instructors cannot rely solely on their position to make an assessment acceptable to their learners _(has to be earned)_
    - **Comprehensive**
        - A comprehensive assessment is not necessarily long, nor must it treat every aspect of the performance in detail.
        - The instructor must decide whether the greater benefit will come from a discussion of a few major points or a number of minor points
        - **An effective assessment covers strengths as well as weaknesses**
    - **Constructive**
        - An assessment is meaningless **unless a learner profits from it**
        - Praise for praise's sake is of no value if a learner is not taught how to capitalize on things that are done well and to improve in areas of lesser accomplishment
        - An instructor **must give positive guidance when identifying a mistake or weakness**.
            - Negative comments that discourage should be omitted altogether
    - **Organized**
        - Almost any pattern is acceptable as long as it is logical and makes sense to the learner
        - An **organizational pattern might be the sequence of the performance itself**
            - EXAMPLE: A flight instructor may explain the _**sequence of events**_ that leads to an undesirable performance on a given flight maneuver.
    - **Thoughtful**
        - An effective assessment **reflects an instructor's thoughtfulness toward the learner's need for self-esteem, recognition, and approval from others**.
            - The assessment must not minimize the inherent dignity and importance of the individual
        - Ridicule, anger, or fun at the expense of the learner has **no place in the assessment**
            - EXAMPLE: Instructor should try to deliver the assessment in private rather than in a group or public setting
    - **Specific**
        - The instructor's **comments and recommendations should be _specific_, not so general that the learner can find nothing to hold onto**
            - Learners cannot act on recommendations and strive to improve unless they know specifically what the recommendations are.
        - Instructors should **express ideas with firmness and authority in terms that cannot be misunderstood or be vague**
            - **Learners should have no doubt what they did well, what they did poorly, and specifically how they can improve**
3) There are **two categories of assessment: _traditional assessment_ and _authentic assessment_**
    - Assessments can be either formal or informal
        - **Formal** assessments usually involve documentation
        - **Informal** assessments can include verbal critique and generally occur _as needed_
