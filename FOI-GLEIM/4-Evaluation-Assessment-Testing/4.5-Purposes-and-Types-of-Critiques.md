## Purposes and Types of Critiques

1) A critique is an instructor-to-learner assessment
    - A critique is not necessarily negative in content
        - It **considers the good along with the bad, the individual parts, the parts in relation to each other, and overall performance**
        - It may be written, oral, or both
        - A critique should always be _conducted immediately after the learner's performance_ while the details are easy to recall
        - The instructor may critique any activity that a leaner performs or practices to improve skill, proficiency, and learning.
        - A critique can and usually should be as varied in content as the performance being evaluated
        - Its purpose should be to provide guidance and direction to raise the level of the learner's performance
    - Types of Critiques
        - **Instructor/Learner Critique**
            - Group discussion in which members of the class are invited to offer criticism of a performance
            - Should be carefully controlled and organized by the instructor
        - **Learner-Led Critique**
            - Learner-led assessment that, while generating learner interest, may not be effective because of learner inexperience
        - **Small Group Critique**
            - Small groups are assigned to analyze a specific area of performance
            - Once combined, a comprehensive assessment results
        - **Individual Learner Critique by Another Learner**
            - This type of critique often allows the group to accept more ownership of the ideas expressed
            - Careful oversight should be maintained by the instructor to control the process
        - **Self-Critique**
            - This type of critique still requires oversight from the instructor
        - **Written Critique**
            - Instructors can devote more time and thought to it than an oral assessment
            - Learners can refer to them as needed
            - Learners have a permanent record of suggestions, recommendations, and opinions
