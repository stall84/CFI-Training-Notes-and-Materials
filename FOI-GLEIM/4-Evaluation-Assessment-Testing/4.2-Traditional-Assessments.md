## Traditional Assessments

1) **Traditional Assessment** often involves written testing and is more likely to be used to evaluate a learner's progress at the _rote_ level of learning.
    - Traditional assessments are **formal in nature**
        - In a traditional assessment, one single answer will be correct (i.e. multiple choice or true/false)
        - EXAMPLE: The FAA knowledge test for a given certificate or rating is a traditional assessment. 
    - Written test questions fall into two general categories: **supply-type** and **selection-type**
    - **Supply-type** questions require the learner to furnish a response in the form of a word, sentence, or paragraph
        - Supply-type test items
            - **Require learners to organize their thoughts and ideas**
            - **Demand the ability to express ideas**
                - This makes them valuable in measuring the learner's generalized understanding of a subject
            - **Are subjective**
                - Thus, their main disadvantage is that they cannot be graded uniformly. The same test graded by different instructors probably would be assigned different scores.
            - **Take longer for learners to answer and for instructors to grade, which is a disadvantage**
    - **Selection-type** questions include items for which two or more alternative responses are provided and there is only one single correct response.
        - Selection-type test items
            - **Are highly objective**
                - Thus they are graded _uniformly_ regardless of the learner or grader
            - **Allow direct comparison of learners' accomplishments**. For example it's possible to compare learner performance...
                - Within the same class
                - Between classes, and
                - Under different instructors.
            - True/false, multiple-choice, and matching type questions are prime examples.
        - **True/False** test items are well adapted to the testing of knowledge of facts and detail, especially when there are only two possible answers.
            - The chief disadvantage of the true/false test item is it creates the greatest probability of _guessing_ because the learner has a 50% chance of guessing correctly.
            - Guidelines for effective use of true/false questions:
                - Include only one idea in each statement
                - Make the statement either entirely true or entirely false
                - Avoid unnecessary use of negatives
                - Avoid absolutes such as "all", "every", "only", "never", etc
        - **Multiple-choice** test items may be used to determine learner achievement, ranging from acquisition of facts to understanding, reasoning, and the ability to apply what has been learned.
            - Multiple-choice test items consist of two parts: the _stem_ and a _list_ of possible responses
                - The stem includes the question, statement, or problem
                - Incorrect responses are called _distractors_
            - When multiple-choice items are intended to measure achievement at a higher level of learning, some or all of the alternatives should be acceptable, but one should _clearly_ be better than the others
            - Multiple-choice test items should have all alternatives of approximately equal length
                - A common error made by instructors is to make the correct choice longer than the incorrect ones.
            - Three major challenges are common in the construction of multiple-choice tests
                - Developing a question or item stem that must be expressed clearly and without ambiguity
                - Developing a statement or correct answer choice that cannot be refuted
                - Writing distractors that are attractive to learners who do not possess the knowledge or understanding necessary to recognize the correct response
            - The following are popular distractors:
                - An incorrect response related to the situation that sounds convincing
                - A common misconception
                - A true statement that does not satisfy the requirements of the problem
                - A statement that is too broad or too narrow for the requirements of the problem
        - **Matching-type** test items are particularly good for measuring the learner's ability to recognize relationships and to make associations between terms, parts, words, phrases, or symbols listed in one column with related items in another column
            - Matching reduces the probability of guessing correct responses compared to a series of multiple-choice items covering the same material.

2) Characteristics of a Good Test
    - **Reliability**
        - The degree to which test results are consistent with repeated measurements
        - The reliability of a written test is determined by whether it gives consistent measurement to a particular individual or group
        - EXAMPLE: A written test that has reliability yields consistent results.
    - **Validity** 
        - The extent to which a test measures what it is supposed to measure
        - This is the **most important consideration** in test evaluation
        - EXAMPLE: A written test has validity when it measures what it's supposed to measure and nothing else
    - **Usability**
        - The functionality of a test
        - EXAMPLE: A written test is usable when it is easy to give and easy to read, the wording is clear and concise, figures are appropriate to the test items and clearly drawn, and the test is easily graded.
    - **Objectivity**
        - Describes singleness of scoring a test
        - Selection-type test items (true/false, etc) are much easier to grade with objectivity
        - EXAMPLE: In essay questions, it is nearly impossible to prevent an instructor’s own biases from affecting the grade subject.
    - **Comprehensiveness**
        - The degree to which a test measures overall objectives
        - A written test must sample an appropriate cross-section of the objectives of instruction
        - EXAMPLE: A written test is said to be comprehensive when it liberally samples whatever is being measured.
    - **Discrimination**
        - The degree to which a test distinguishes the differences between learners
        - Three features of a test constructed to identify the differences in achievement of learners are:
            - A wide range of scores
            - All levels of difficulty
            - Items that distinguish between learners with differing levels of achievement of the course objectives
        - EXAMPLE: A written test having the characteristic of discrimination will measure small differences in achievement between learners.
