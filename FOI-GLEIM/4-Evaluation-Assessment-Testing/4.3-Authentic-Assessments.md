## Authentic Assessments

1) **Authentic assessment** _**requires the learner to demonstrate not only the rote and understanding levels but also the application and correlation levels of learning**_. Authentic assessment generally requires the learner to **perform real-world tasks to demonstrate a meaningful application of skills**.
    - In an authentic assessment, specific standards are used to define acceptable performance of a task
        - EXAMPLE: **"The practical"** or flight, portion of the flight maneuvers test is an _authentic assessment_
    - Learners must generate responses from _**skills and concepts previously learned**_
    - Authentic assessment **focuses on the learning process**, <u>**enhances the development of real-world skills</u>, <u>encourages higher order thinking skills (HOTS)</u> and teaches learners <u>to assess their own work and performance**</u>
    - Authentic assessment <u>may not be as useful as traditional assessment in the _**earl**y**_ phases of training</u> because the learner may not have enough information or knowledge about the concepts to participate fully

2) **Learner-centered assessment**, an aspect of authentic assessment, is a form of learner-centered grading that uses open-ended questions to guide the learner through a self-assessment.
    - The purpose of self-assessment is **to stimulate growth in the learner's thought process and, in turn their behaviors**. The 4 steps of of learner-centered assessment:
        - **Replay** - Asking the learner to verbally replay the flight or procedure
            - This step gives the learner a chance to **validate their own perceptions**. It also **gives the instructor critical insight into the learner's judgment abilities**
        - **Reconstruct** - Having the learner **identify key things that they should or could have done differently during the flight or maneuver**
        - **Reflect** - Asking questions that require reflection on the event, _often leading to insight_
            - EXAMPLES:
                - _What was the most important thing you learned today?_
                - _What part of the session was easiest for you? What part was the hardest?_
                - _Did anything make you uncomfortable? If so, when did it occur?_
                - _How would you assess your performance and your decisions?_ 
                - _How did your performance compare to the standards in the ACS?_
                - _If you had to do it again, what would you do differently?_
        - **Redirect** - Helping the learner relate the lessons learned to _other experiences_ and consider how they might help in future sessions. 
            - EXAMPLE: _"What aspects of this flight might apply to future situations, and how?"_
    - Learner-centered assessment uses these two broad grading rubrics:
        - One rubric that **assesses proficiency in skill-focused maneuvers or procedures**
        - A second rubric that **focuses on the decision-making aspect of flight training (referred to as SRM, a subset of ADM for single pilots)**
            - Advantages of this form of assessment include the following:
                - It actively involves the learner
                - It establishes the habit of reflection and self-assessment
                - The grades are not self-esteem related because they describe a level of performance. A learner cannot flunk a lesson
                - This assessment is conducted jointly between the instructor and the learner.

3) Maneuver or procedure grades have the following grading dimensions:
    - **Describe** - The learner **is able to describe the elements of the scenario** _**but needs assistance to execute the maneuver properly**_
    - **Explain** - The learner **is able to describe the elements of the scenario, _and_ understands the concepts and principles that comprise the activity but needs assistance to execute the maneuver properly**
    - **Practice** - The learner **is able to plan and execute the scenario with _some coaching_**
    - **Perform** - The learner **is able to perform the activity _without instructor assistance_ and _identifies and makes corrections_ in a timely manner. Indicates satisfactory demonstration**
    - **Not observed** - Any event not accomplished or required

4) Assessing risk management skills involves the following grading dimensions of SRM:
    - **Explain** - The learner **can verbally identify, describe, and understands risks but needs to be prompted to make decisions**
    - **Practice** - The learner properly **identifies, understands, and applies SRM principles and corrects minor deviations id'd by the instructor. _In this dimension, the learner is an active decision maker**_
    - **Manage-Decide** - The learner **correctly gathers information, ids proper course of action, evaluates risks for _each_ course of action, and makes the appropriate decisions _without_ instructor input.**
