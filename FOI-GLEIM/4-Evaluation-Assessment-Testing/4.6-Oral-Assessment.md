## Oral Assessment

1) The **most common means** of assessment is direct or indirect oral questioning of learners by the instructor. Questions may be **loosely classified as fact questions and higher-order -thinking-skills (HOTS) questions**.
    - The answer to a **fact question** is based on memory or recall _**(i.e., who, what, where, when, why)**_
    - **HOTS questions require the learner to _combine a knowledge of facts_ with an _ability to analyze situations_, _solve problems_, and _arrive at conclusions_**
    - Proper quizzing by the instructor can have a number of desirable results, It can
        - **Reveal the effectiveness of the instructor's training** methods
        - **Check learner retention and comprehension** of what has been learned
        - **Review material already presented** to the learner
        - **Help retain learner interest** and stimulate thinking
        - **Emphasize the important points** of training
        - **Identify points that need more emphasis**, and
        - **Promote active learner participation**

2) <u>**Characteristics of effective questions**</u>
    - Objective, or fact, questions have only _one_ correct answer, while the answer to open-ended HOTS questions can be expressed in a variety of possible situations. Each question should call for a specific answer that can be readily evaluated by the instructor.
    - Effective questions must
        - **Apply to the subject being taught**
        - **Be brief and concise, but also clear and definite**
        - **Be adapted to the ability, experience, and stage of training of the learner**
        - **Center on only _one idea (who, what, when, where, how, or why NOT a combination of those)_**
        - **Present a challenge to the learner**
            - A question must be of suitable difficulty for the learners at that particular stage of training

3) <u>**Types of questions to avoid include the following**></u>
    - **Yes/no questions**. For example: _"Do you understand?"_
    - **Puzzling questions** - ones that **do not provide a clear, definite objective**. For example: _"Which of the airplane systems is the most responsive to pilot inputs?"_
    - **Oversize questions** - ones **that are too broad in scope and could have multiple correct/incorrect responses**. Again, no definite objective is stated. For example: _"What is required before going flying?"_
    - **Toss-up questions** - **more than one correct response is possible**. For example: _"In an emergency, should you squawk 7700 or pick a landing spot?"_
    - **Bewilderment questions** - questions **that mentally confuse**. For example: _"In reading the altimeter, if you take teperature into account, as when flying from a cold air mass through a warm front, what precaution should you take when in mountainous areas?"_
    - **Trick questions** - **questinos that cause the learner to feel they are engaged in a battle of wits with the instructor**, thus changing the learner focus from the message to the messenger. For example: Using double negatives, _"What is not a characteristic of not relying solely on flight instruments during flight in IMC?"_
    - **Irrelevant questions** - Diversions that introduce unrelated facts and thoughts and slow learner progress. For example: _"How would the wing produce lift in outer space?"_

4) **Answering learner questions authentically requires the instructor to clearly understand the question before attempting an answer**
    - The instructor **should display interest in the learner's questions** and give as **direct and accurate an answer as possible**
    - If a learner's question is too advanced for the particular lesson and confusion may result from a complete answer, the instructor may 
        - Carefully explain that the question was good and pertinent;
        - Explain that to answer would unnecessarily complicate the learning task at hand 
        - Advise the learner to reintroduce the question later at the appropriate point in training or meet outside class for a more complete discussion
    - Occasionally, a learner will ask a question the instructor cannot answer. **The best course is to freely admit not knowing the answer**
        - The **instructor should then promise to find out** or **offer to help the learner look it up in appropriate references**
