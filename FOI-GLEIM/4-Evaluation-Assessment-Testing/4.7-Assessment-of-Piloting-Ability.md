## Assessment of Piloting Ability

1) Review and evaluation of learning should be an integral part of each lesson that provides direction and guidance to raise the level of performance
    - Evaluation of learner performance and accomplishment **should be based on the objectives and goals established in the lesson plan**
        - Lesson plans guide the training process, helping learners know what they need to achieve.
    - Assessment of demonstrated ability during flight instruction **must be based on _established standards_ of performance**
        - The established standards **ensure that a learner is evaluated objectively and not subjectively**
    - **Performance testing is desirable for evaluating training that _involves an operation, procedure, or process_**
        - This method of evaluation is particularly suited to the measurement of a learner's **demonstrated ability in performing a task, either mental or physical**
        - Demonstrated ability assessments **must be suitably modified to the learner's stage of development and experience**
    - **Learners may perform a procedure or maneuver correctly but not fully understand the principles and objectives involved.** _If the instructor suspects this, learners should be required to vary the performance of the maneuver or procedure slightly_
         - Learners who do not understand the principles involved will probably not be able to successfully complete the revised maneuver or procedure
    - Piloting assessments can often be tools for reteaching when opportunities arise.
