## Choosing an Effective Assessment Method

1) An effective assessment provides critical insight to both the instructor and learner
    - To **choose an effective assessment method**, flight instructors can use a four-step process. 
        - <u>**Determine level-of-learning objectives**</u>
            - The individual objectives are stated as general level-of-learning objectives
            - **Because it defines the scope of the learning task**, this is a good starting point for developing a test
        - <u>**List indicators/samples of desired behaviors**</u>
            - List the **indicators of behavior that give the best indication of the achievement of the objective**
            - By carefully choosing these indicators of behavior, an instructor can obtain adequate evidence of learning.
        - <u>**Establish criterion objectives**</u>
            - Define **criterion (performance-based) objectives** that **state the conditions under which the behavior is to be performed** and the criteria that must be met
            - Criterion objectives provide the framework for developing test items that will measure the level of learning objectives.
                - EXAMPLE: _'The learner will demonstrate understanding of navigational charts and their symbols by completing a quiz with a minimum passing score of 70%'_
        - <u>**Develop criterion-referenced assessment items**</u>
            - Criterion-referenced testing measures a learner's performance against a carefully written, measurable standard or criterion.
                - **Practical tests for pilot certification are an example of criterion-referenced testing** because **they are based on the predetermined Practical Test Standards (PTS)/Airman Certification Standards (ACS) as set forth by the FAA**
                - The objective of the PTS/ACS is to ensure the certification of pilots at a high level of performance and proficiency, consistent with safety.
                - The PTS/ACS should not be used merely to 'teach the test' rather, the document should be used as both a training tool and an assessment tool during flight training to ensure learners are adequately prepared for the practical test 
                - The PTS/ACS is _not a teaching tool_. **It is a testing tool**. The overall focus of flight training should be on education, learning, and understanding why the standards are there and how they were set.
            - **Criterion-referenced tests feature performance-based objectives that can be reliably, rather than subjectively measured**
            - Performance testing is desirable for evaluating training that involves an operation, a procedure, or a process
                - EXAMPLE: A pretest constructed to measure knowledge and skills necessary to begin a course is a criterion-referenced test, as is a pre-solo aeronautical knowledge test.
            - The test results identify areas that were not adequately covered
