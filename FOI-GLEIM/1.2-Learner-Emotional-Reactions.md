1) **Anxiety** and **stress** are significant psychological factors affecting flight instruction prompting differing responses.
    - An individual may normally react to stress by responding **rapidly** and **exactly**, often automatically, within their experience and training.
        - Thus proper training prior to emergency situations is critical.
        - The effective individual thinks quickly, acts decisively, and is extremely sensitive to their surroundings.
    - Abnormal reactions to stress may result in inadequate, illogical, or random responses, including
        - Inappropriate reactions, such as extreme over-cooperation, painstaking self-control, inappropriate laughter or singing, and very rapid changes in emotion
        - Marked changes in mood
        - Severe, unreasonable anger toward instructor or others.
    - **Anxiety** is a _**feeling of worry, nervousness, or unease, often about something that is going to happen, typically with an uncertain outcome. It results from the fear of anything, real or imagined, which threatens the person who experiences it, and may have a potent effect on actions and the ability to learn from perceptions**_. 
        - Anxiety is probably the most significant psychological barrier affecting flight instruction. It is the extreme worry brought on by stressful situations (e.g. an emergency, an exam, etc.) **Anxiety can be countered by**:
            - _Treating fears as normal reaction rather than ignoring them_
            - _Reinforcing the learner's enjoyment of flying_
            - _Teaching learners to cope with fears_
    
2) **Impatience** is **a greater deterrent to learning pilot skills than is generally recognized**.
