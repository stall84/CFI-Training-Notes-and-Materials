1) **Anxiety** and **stress** are significant psychological factors affecting flight instruction prompting differing responses.
    - An individual may normally react to stress by responding **rapidly** and **exactly**, often automatically, within their experience and training.
        - Thus proper training prior to emergency situations is critical.
        - The effective individual thinks quickly, acts decisively, and is extremely sensitive to their surroundings.
    - Abnormal reactions to stress may result in inadequate, illogical, or random responses, including
        - Inappropriate reactions, such as extreme over-cooperation, painstaking self-control, inappropriate laughter or singing, and very rapid changes in emotion
        - Marked changes in mood
        - Severe, unreasonable anger toward instructor or others.
    - **Anxiety** is a _**feeling of worry, nervousness, or unease, often about something that is going to happen, typically with an uncertain outcome. It results from the fear of anything, real or imagined, which threatens the person who experiences it, and may have a potent effect on actions and the ability to learn from perceptions**_. 
        - Anxiety is probably the most significant psychological barrier affecting flight instruction. It is the extreme worry brought on by stressful situations (e.g. an emergency, an exam, etc.) **Anxiety can be countered by**:
            - _Treating fears as normal reaction rather than ignoring them_
            - _Reinforcing the learner's enjoyment of flying_
            - _Teaching learners to cope with fears_
    
2) **Impatience** is **a greater deterrent to learning pilot skills than is generally recognized**. For example a student wanting to fly solo early on in training or to make a cross country flight before fundamentals are learned adequately.
    - The impatient learner fails to understand the need for preliminary training. They seek only the final objective without considering the means necessary to reach it. 
        - Instructors can correct impatience by presenting the necessary preliminary training one step at a time, with clearly stated goals for each step. _Effectively (not antagonistically or condescendingly) communicate the necessity to learn the fundamentals for competent, safe flight to proceed further._
        - Impatience can result from instruction that is set to a pace for a slower learner when applied to a faster learner. Instructor's should analyze each learner independently and asses their ability (and teach to that pace) to avoid this trait, because it can severely demoralize the student. _(Consider your experience with Jack making you fly the same maneuvers day after day milking $)_
    - Impatience can be closely linked to overconfidence in a learner because both stem from an learner's belief that they grasp concepts faster than they actually do.
    - For apt learners, good instructors will constantly raise the bar and standard of performance to keep them working and displaying effort.

3) **Worry or Lack of Interest: has a detrimental effect on learning**.
    - _**Learners who are worried or emotionally upset are not ready to learn, and often will derive little benefit from instruction**_.
        - Sources of worry or distraction include the following:
            - Concerns about progress in the training course _(Again, consider your feelings with Jack when it became apparent he was dragging out the lessons for no valid reason)_
            - External circumstances unrelated to instruction
        - Significant emotional upsets include the following:
            - Personal or emotional problems
            - Dislike of the training program or the instructor _(We've had this with about 1 in 4 instructors in the past)_
    - _Experiences outside of training significantly affect learner behavior and performance, **and that influence cannot be separated from the learning process**_.
        - Bringing personal interests and challenges into training affects training results.
        - _Learners begin flight training with enthusiasm, fears, and personal concerns that shape their engagement_. _An instructor should be able to recognize and address these factors to ensure effective learning_.
        - The instructor role involves managing distraction to maintain a normal learning pace.
            - Instruction should leverage the interests and enthusiasm learners bring.
            - Training should redirect worries and distractions toward productive learning.
        - The instructor should be alert and ensure the learners understand the objectives of each step of their training and that they know at the completion of each lesson exactly how well they have progressed and what deficiencies are apparent.
        - _**Discouragement and emotional upsets are rare when learners feel that nothing is being withheld from them or is being neglected in their training**_.

4) **Physical Discomfort**: Illness, fatigue, and dehydration slows the rate of learning during both classroom instruction and flight training by impairing cognitive function and physical performance. _(consider early morning flight on a stomach with nothing but black coffee (yikes))_
    - Learners who are not completely at ease and whose attention is diverted by discomforts such as extremes of temperature, poor ventilation _(Jack's dip spit coming back through the cabin-heat during slow flight)_, inadequate lighting, or noise and confusion **cannot learn at a normal rate**
    - **Minor (or major) illness like Cold/Flu greatly interfere with rates of learning**
        - Not only for attention reasons, but they can acutely affect vision, hearing, feeling.
        - **Airsickness** will surely completely incapacitate the learner from any learning function. Resistance or immunity to it can usually be built over time. Lesson flights should be terminated at the first indication of incipient air sickness in the learner. Gradually over time with subsequent flights on different days, immunity should be gained.
        - Keeping learners interested and occupied during flight is a deterrent to airsickness. They are much less apt to become airsick while operating the controls themselves _(similar to carsickness from the rear seats when you're not at the wheel)_. Blowing fresh air across the face also helps reduce symptoms. Abrupt maneuvers, rough-air, tension and apprehension contribute to it and should be avoided.
    - **Fatigue** is one of the most treacherous hazards to flight safety in general, as it might not always be apparent to a pilot until serious errors are made. Fatigue can also be acute or chronic.
        - **Acute Fatigue**: _**A normal occurrence of everyday living, is the tiredness felt after long periods of physical and mental strain, including strenuous muscular effort, immobility, heavy mental workload, strong emotional pressure, monotony, and lack of sleep**_
            - An instructor who is familiar with the signs indicative of acute fatigue will be more aware if the learner is experiencing them, as the signs of acute fatigue are often apparent to others before the individual notices any signs themselves.
            - Acute fatigue is characterized by:
                - Inattention 
                - Distractibility 
                - Errors in timing 
                - Neglect of secondary tasks
                - Loss of accuracy and control
                - Lack of awareness of error accumulation
                - Irritability 
        - **Chronic Fatigue**: _**A combination of both physiological problems and psychological issues and occurs when there is not enough time for a full recovery from repeated episodes of acute fatigue.
            - Without resolution, human performance continues to fall off, judgment becomes impaired, and unwarranted risks may be taken.
            - Recovery from chronic fatigue requires a prolonged and deliberate solution. Origins of chronic fatigue may not just be 'rest related' and have deeper origins.
            - Psychological problems such as financial, home life, or job-related stresses cause lack of quality rest.
        - **Dehydration**: The term given to critical loss of water from the body
            - It will reduce a pilot's level of alertness, producing a subsequent slowing of decision-making processes or even the inability to control the aircraft.
            - Fatigue is the first noticeable effect of dehydration.
            - Flying for long periods in hot summer temperatures or at high altitude increases susceptibility to dehydration.
            - High altitude is an issue since the dry air tends to increase the rate of water loss from the body (breath, etc)
            - Without fluid replenishment, fatigue progresses to: 
                - Weakness
                - Abdominal Cramps
                - Nausea
                - Tingling in extremities 
                - Extreme Thirst
                - Dizziness
            - Heatstroke occurs when the body fails to regulate it's temperature. It shares symptoms with dehydration, though it can lead to organ failure or collapse if it goes undetected / untreated. 
            - Ample supply of water should be carried and used at frequent intervals whether feeling thirsty or not. Keep flight deck well ventilated
            
5) **Apathy** due to inadequate instruction can arise when learners recognize the instructor has made inadequate preparations or when the instruction appears to be deficient, contradictory, or insincere
    - Instructors should provide well-planned, appropriate, and accurate instruction.
    - To be **effective** _the instructor teaches to the level of the learner_.
    - Instruction may be overly explicit and complicated, too elementary, or so general that it fails to evoke the interest necessary for effective learning.
    - Poor instructional presentations may result not only from poor preparation, but also from distracting mannerisms, personal untidiness, or the appearance of irritation with the learner _(Josiah)_
    - **Creating the impression of talking-down to the learner is one of the fastest ways for an instructor to lose learner confidence and attention**
    - Once the instructor loses learner's confidence, it's difficult to regain, and the learning rate is unnecessarily diminished.
