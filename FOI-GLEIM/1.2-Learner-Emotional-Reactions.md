1) **Anxiety** and **stress** are significant psychological factors affecting flight instruction prompting differing responses.
    - An individual may normally react to stress by responding **rapidly** and **exactly**, often automatically, within their experience and training.
        - Thus proper training prior to emergency situations is critical.
        - The effective individual thinks quickly, acts decisively, and is extremely sensitive to their surroundings.
    - Abnormal reactions to stress may result in inadequate, illogical, or random responses, including
        - Inappropriate reactions, such as extreme over-cooperation, painstaking self-control, inappropriate laughter or singing, and very rapid changes in emotion
        - Marked changes in mood
        - Severe, unreasonable anger toward instructor or others.
    - **Anxiety** is a _**feeling of worry, nervousness, or unease, often about something that is going to happen, typically with an uncertain outcome. It results from the fear of anything, real or imagined, which threatens the person who experiences it, and may have a potent effect on actions and the ability to learn from perceptions**_. 
        - Anxiety is probably the most significant psychological barrier affecting flight instruction. It is the extreme worry brought on by stressful situations (e.g. an emergency, an exam, etc.) **Anxiety can be countered by**:
            - _Treating fears as normal reaction rather than ignoring them_
            - _Reinforcing the learner's enjoyment of flying_
            - _Teaching learners to cope with fears_
    
2) **Impatience** is **a greater deterrent to learning pilot skills than is generally recognized**. For example a student wanting to fly solo early on in training or to make a cross country flight before fundamentals are learned adequately.
    - The impatient learner fails to understand the need for preliminary training. They seek only the final objective without considering the means necessary to reach it. 
        - Instructors can correct impatience by presenting the necessary preliminary training one step at a time, with clearly stated goals for each step. _Effectively (not antagonistically or condescendingly) communicate the necessity to learn the fundamentals for competent, safe flight to proceed further._
        - Impatience can result from instruction that is set to a pace for a slower learner when applied to a faster learner. Instructor's should analyze each learner independently and asses their ability (and teach to that pace) to avoid this trait, because it can severely demoralize the student. _(Consider your experience with Jack making you fly the same maneuvers day after day milking $)_
    - Impatience can be closely linked to overconfidence in a learner because both stem from an learner's belief that they grasp concepts faster than they actually do.
    - For apt learners, good instructors will constantly raise the bar and standard of performance to keep them working and displaying effort.

3) **Worry or lack of interest has a detrimental effect on learning**.
    - _**Learners who are worried or emotionally upset are not ready to learn, and often will derive little benefit from instruction**_.
        - Sources of worry or distraction include the following:
            - Concerns about progress in the training course _(Again, consider your feelings with Jack when it became apparent he was dragging out the lessons for no valid reason)_
            - External circumstances unrelated to instruction
        - Significant emotional upsets include the following:
            - Personal or emotional problems
            - Dislike of the training program or the instructor _(We've had this with about 1 in 4 instructors in the past)_
    - _Experiences outside of training significantly affect learner behavior and performance, **and that influence cannot be separated from the learning process**_.
