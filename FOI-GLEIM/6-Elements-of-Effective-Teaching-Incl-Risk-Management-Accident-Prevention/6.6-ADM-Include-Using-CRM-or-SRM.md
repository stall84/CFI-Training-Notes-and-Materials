## Aeronautical Decision Making (ADM) to Include Using Crew Resource Management (CRM) or Single-Pilot Resource Management (SRM)

1) Aeronautical Decision Making (ADM) is explored through teaching risk identification, assessment, and mitigation in [Subunit 6.1](./6.1-Teaching-Risk-Identification-Assessment-Mitigation.md)
    - It (ADM) is a **core component of single-pilot resource management (SRM), _reinforcing decision making with effective resource management_**
        - It is the foundation for pilot judgment, but to integrate it fully into flight operations, it must be connected to SRM
        - ADM is not an _isolated skill_, and it **interacts with environmental and operational pressures to shape decision making**
    - SRM builds on the decision-making framework established in ADM _**by incorporating risk management strategies, automation, and external resources**_
    - **SRM is the _art and science_ of managing the resources available to a single pilot** to ensure the safe and successful outcome of a flight operation.
        - **Effective SRM instruction teaches learners to _gather information, analyze it, and make decisions_**
            - Assertive communication
            - Task delegation
            - Error management
        - SRM requires the individual to internalize and self-manage these competencies and is the single-pilot adaptation of CRM
    - To aid pilots in _understanding SRM_, the **5P checklist** was created. This checklist **looks at five key elements in the SRM process: the _Plan, Plane, Pilot, Passengers, and Programming_**
        - Each of these areas **_consists of a set of challenges and opportunities that face a single pilot_**, and **each can substantially increase or decrease the risks of successfully completing the flight based on the pilot's ability to make informed and timely decisions**
        - Instructors can **use the 5P checklist to help learners evaluate their operational environment _at key decision points_**, reinforcing risk-based thinking and situational awareness. These decision points include:
            - **Preflight**
            - **Pretakeoff**
            - **Hourly or at the midpoint of the flight**
            - **Predescent**
            - **Just prior to the final approach fix (for IFR ops) or just prior to entering the traffic pattern (for VFR ops)**
        - _Each of the 5Ps should be considered at each decision point during a flight_
    - **CRM** refers to the **effective use of _all available resources: human resources, hardware, and information to achieve safe and efficient flight operations_**
        - CRM foundations embedded in SRM are not simply carried over from multi-crew operations; they are reconfigured to meet the demands of single-pilot environments. 
        - **_Assertive communication_, _task delegation_, and _error management_ are adapted for use <u>_without a crew_</u>**, requiring the pilot to manage them independently, meaning
            - Clear communication
            - Planning how and when to use automation
            - **Procedurally catching errors through regular cross-checks**
        - CRM expands the decision-making ecosystem beyond ADM and SRM by introducing a collaborative, systems-based approach to safety.
            - CRM encompasses interactions with ATC, dispatchers, maintenance personnel, and qualified passengers
            - These CRM elements are reflected throughout the 5Ps, along with considerations on how to effectively use them in your everyday piloting.
    - The discussion that follows is an in-depth look at each of the 5 Ps, along with considerations on how to effectively use them in your everyday piloting.
        - <u>**Plan**</u>
            - The plan can also be called the mission or the task. **It contains the basic elements of cross-country planning: _weather, route, fuel, current publications_, etc**
            - **The plan should be reviewed and updated several times during the course of the flight**
                - A delayed takeoff due to maintenance, fast-moving weather, and a short-notice temporary flight restriction TFR may all radically alter the plan
                - The plan is always being updated and modified and is especially responsive to changes in the other four Ps
            - Obviously weather is a huge part of any plan
                - The addition of real-time datalink weather information provided by advanced avionics gives the pilot a real advantage during inclement weather, but only if the pilot is trained to retrieve and evaluate the weather in real time without sacrificing situational awareness.
                - Pilots of aircraft without datalink weather or without the ability to effectively interpret it should get updated weather in flight through FSS.
        - <u>**Plane**</u>
            - The plane consists of the usual array of mechanical and cosmetic issues that every aircraft pilot, owner, or operator can identify.
            - With the advent of advanced avionics, the plane has expanded to include **database currency, automation status, and emergency backup systems** that were unknown a few years ago
            - Pilots must **_regularly review airplane system operations to ensure all systems are within operating limits and to spot potential risk factors while they are more easily manageable_**
        - <u>**Pilot**</u>
            - Flying, especially when used for business transportation, can expose the pilot to high-altitude flying, long distance and endurance, and more challenging weather.
                - An **advanced avionics aircraft, simply due to its advanced capabilities, can expose a pilot to _even more_ of these stresses**.
            - The 5P process helps a pilot to recognize before takeoff the physiological situation that may exist at the end of the flight and continue updating personal conditions as the flight progresses.
                - Once risks are identified, the pilot is better equipped to make alternate plans that lessen the effects of these factors and provide a safer solution.
        - <u>**Passengers**</u>
            - Passengers present a unique situation because, depending on the circumstances of the flight, these individuals can be co-pilots
                - Passengers can re-read and help you verify checklist items, keep your navigation materials organized and accessible, and assist with many other tasks.
                - Obviously, in some circumstances, it would not be appropriate to utilize passengers in such a manner
                - Be careful to consider what roles your passengers could play in reducing your workload.
            - Passengers can also **create additional pressures on the pilot _to complete the flight as planned or take unnecessary risks_**
                - You should plan for passenger pressures any time they will be on board. Planning in advance allows you to be ready to handle them
        - <u>**Programming**</u>
            - The advanced avionics in modern aircraft adds an entirely new dimension to the way general aviation (GA) aircraft are flown.
                - The electronic instrument displays, GPS, and autopilot reduce pilot workload and increase pilot situational awareness.
                - The pilot must be trained to properly use these avionics for them to be utilized effectively
            - Although the programming and operation of these devices are fairly simple and straightforward (unlike analog instruments), they tend to capture a pilot's attention and hold it for long periods of time _(distraction)_
                - To avoid this phenomenon, **the pilot should plan in advance when and where the programming for approaches, route changes, and airport information gathering should be accomplished**
                - Pilot familiarity with the equipment, the route, the local ATC, and personal capabilities in using the automation should dictate when, where and how the automation is programmed and used
        - **Risk can be reduced to the lowest possible level by using the concepts of ADM, risk management, situational awareness, and SRM**
