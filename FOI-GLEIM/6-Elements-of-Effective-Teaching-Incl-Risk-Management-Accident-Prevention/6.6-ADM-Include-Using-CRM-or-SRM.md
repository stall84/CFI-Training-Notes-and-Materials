## Aeronautical Decision Making (ADM) to Include Using Crew Resource Management (CRM) or Single-Pilot Resource Management (SRM)

1) Aeronautical Decision Making (ADM) is explored through teaching risk identification, assessment, and mitigation in [Subunit 6.1](./6.1-Teaching-Risk-Identification-Assessment-Mitigation.md)
    - It (ADM) is a **core component of single-pilot resource management (SRM), _reinforcing decision making with effective resource management_**
        - It is the foundation for pilot judgment, but to integrate it fully into flight operations, it must be connected to SRM
        - ADM is not an _isolated skill_, and it **interacts with environmental and operational pressures to shape decision making**
    - SRM builds on the decision-making framework established in ADM _**by incorporating risk management strategies, automation, and external resources**_
    - **SRM is the _art and science_ of managing the resources available to a single pilot** to ensure the safe and successful outcome of a flight operation.
        - **Effective SRM instruction teaches learners to _gather information, analyze it, and make decisions_**
            - Assertive communication
            - Task delegation
            - Error management
        - SRM requires the individual to internalize and self-manage these competencies and is the single-pilot adaptation of CRM
    - To aid pilots in _understanding SRM_, the **5P checklist** was created. This checklist **looks at five key elements in the SRM process: the _Plan, Plane, Pilot, Passengers, and Programming_**
        - Each of these areas **_consists of a set of challenges and opportunities that face a single pilot_**, and **each can substantially increase or decrease the risks of successfully completing the flight based on the pilot's ability to make informed and timely decisions**
        - Instructors can **use the 5P checklist to help learners evaluate their operational environment _at key decision points_**, reinforcing risk-based thinking and situational awareness. These decision points include:
            - **Preflight**
            - **Pretakeoff**
            - **Hourly or at the midpoint of the flight**
            - **Predescent**
            - **Just prior to the final approach fix (for IFR ops) or just prior to entering the traffic pattern (for VFR ops)**
        - _Each of the 5Ps should be considered at each decision point during a flight_
    - **CRM** refers to the **effective use of _all available resources: human resources, hardware, and information to achieve safe and efficient flight operations_**
