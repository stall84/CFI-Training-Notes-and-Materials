## Risk Management Teaching Techniques by Phase of Introduction

1) Flight instructors **should integrate risk management, ADM, situational awareness, and SRM throughout the entire training course for all levels of learners**. The <u>3P model</u> **is a systematic decision-making framework providing a foundation for effective risk management**
    - Build upon this and introduce a more proactive model that centralizes the common risk factors across all phases of instruction: _**the pilot**_
        - **I AM RISK** model
            - **I**dentify risks early
            - **A**ssess their impact
            - **M**itigate threats effectively
2) Instructors should teach risk management **using a building block approach**. This method is effective for both new pilots and experienced pilots who have not had formal risk management training.
    - Risk management training
        - Through the **private pilot level**
            - **Pre-Solo**
                - Instructor-led and -guided risk management training.
            - **Post-solo**
                - Learner risk analysis consistently reviewed and refined
            - **Cross-country training**
                - Learner-mastered risk management techniques commensurate to the complexity of the flights
        - For **experienced pilots**
            - **Instrument training**
                - Enhanced risk management techniques and strategy
            - **Transition training**
                - Correlated risk management with emphasis on SRM proficiency
            - **Recurrent training**
                - Review ACS and formal risk management training
        - During **operational flights**
            - Emphasize scaled risk management procedures relative to flight complexity
        - For **professional pilots**
            - Re-emphasize and adapt risk management responsibility
            - Evaluate **threat and error management (TEM)**, risk management profile, habits, and operating exposures.
