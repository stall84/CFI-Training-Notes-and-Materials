## When and How to Introduce Risk Management

1) **_It is never too early to start teaching risk management_**. Like all basic aircraft control, risk management must become **automatic (second nature)**. The best way to develop these habits is through repetition and strict adherence to procedures.
2) **<u>Perceive, Process, Perform (The 3P Model)</u>** is a decision-making framework for aeronautical decision making (ADM). It helps instructors teach pilots how to systematically identify hazards, assess risks, and apply effective control.
    - <u>Step 1</u> is to **develop situational awareness by perceiving hazards through present events, objects, or circumstances that could contribute to a negative future event**
        - The pilot **perceives** the given set of circumstances for a flight
            - The pilot systematically identifies and lists hazards associated with the flight: pilot, aircraft, environment, and external pressures (PAVE)
    - <u>Step 2</u> is to process this data to determine whether the identified hazards pose a risk based on their potential future impact if unmitigated or left uncontrolled
        - The pilot **processes** information by evaluating the impact of those circumstances on flight safety.
            - The pilot assess risk in terms of
                - **Exposure** _(number of people or resources affected)_
                - **Severity** _(extent of possible loss)_
                - **Probability** _(likelihood that hazard causes loss)_
    - <u>Step 3</u> is to **perform** by taking action to eliminate hazards or mitigate risk and then continuously evaluate the outcome of this action
        - The pilot performs by implementing the best course of action

3) **The decision-making process is a _continuous loop of perceiving, processing, and performing_**
    - Once the 3P process completes, it will automatically restart in a cycle to assess the new and next set of circumstances
    - **Incorporate the 3P discussion as a standard feature of preflight briefings and integrate it into daily training routines**
