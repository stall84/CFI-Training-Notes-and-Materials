## Teaching Risk Identification, Assessment, and Mitigation

1) **Aeronautical Decision Making (ADM)** can be defined as a **systematic approach to the mental process used by pilots to consistently determine the best course of action in response to a given set of circumstances
    - One step in the ADM process for good decision making is to **identify personal attitudes hazardous to safe flight**
        - Examples of classical behavioral traps that experienced pilots may fall into are the **_compulsion to complete a flight as planned_**, **_the desire to please passengers_**, **_the pressure to meet schedules_**, and **_the determination to get the job done_**.
        - At some time, many experienced pilots have fallen prey to dangerous tendencies or behavior problems that must be identified and eliminated, including
            - **Peer pressure**
            - **Scud running**
            - **Loss of positional or situational awareness**
            - **Operating without adequate fuel reserves**
        - In order to gain a realistic perspective on your attitude toward flying, you should take a <u>Self-Assessment Hazardous Attitude Inventory Test</u>
            - ADM addresses the following five hazardous attitudes:
                - **<u>Antiauthority</u>** - _"Do not tell me what to do!"_
                    - EXAMPLE: During a stall recovery, the CFI allows the learner to exceed maneuvering speed. An antiauthority attitude expressed by the CFI would be "The aircraft can handle a lot more than the maneuvering speed"
                - **<u>Impulsivity</u>** - _"Do something quickly!"_
                    - EXAMPLE: On short final, the CFI realizes his learner has forgotten to lower the flaps and immediately adds full flaps. The impulsivity attitude expressed by the CFI would be "I have to extend the flaps to get this aircraft down."
