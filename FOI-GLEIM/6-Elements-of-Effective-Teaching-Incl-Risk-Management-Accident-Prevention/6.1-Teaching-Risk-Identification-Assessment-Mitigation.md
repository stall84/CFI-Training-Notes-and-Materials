## Teaching Risk Identification, Assessment, and Mitigation

1) **Aeronautical Decision Making (ADM)** can be defined as a **systematic approach to the mental process used by pilots to consistently determine the best course of action in response to a given set of circumstances
    - One step in the ADM process for good decision making is to **identify personal attitudes hazardous to safe flight**
        - Examples of classical behavioral traps that experienced pilots may fall into are the **_compulsion to complete a flight as planned_**, **_the desire to please passengers_**, **_the pressure to meet schedules_**, and **_the determination to get the job done_**.
        - At some time, many experienced pilots have fallen prey to dangerous tendencies or behavior problems that must be identified and eliminated, including
            - **Peer pressure**
            - **Scud running**
            - **Loss of positional or situational awareness**
            - **Operating without adequate fuel reserves**
        - In order to gain a realistic perspective on your attitude toward flying, you should take a <u>Self-Assessment Hazardous Attitude Inventory Test</u>
            - ADM addresses the following five hazardous attitudes:
                - **<u>Antiauthority</u>** - _"Do not tell me what to do!"_
                    - EXAMPLE: During a stall recovery, the CFI allows the learner to exceed maneuvering speed. An antiauthority attitude expressed by the CFI would be "The aircraft can handle a lot more than the maneuvering speed"
                - **<u>Impulsivity</u>** - _"Do something quickly!"_
                    - EXAMPLE: On short final, the CFI realizes his learner has forgotten to lower the flaps and immediately adds full flaps. The impulsivity attitude expressed by the CFI would be "I have to extend the flaps to get this aircraft down."
                - **<u>Invulnerability</u>** - _"It will not happen to me"_
                    - EXAMPLE: Before a flight, the CFI does not check to verify a learner has completed a preflight inspection. The invulnerability attitude expressed by the CFI would be "Nothing bad will happen on this flight"
                - **<u>Macho</u>** - _"I can do it"_
                    - EXAMPLE: A pilot is on an instrument approach in which the aircraft in front of him have had to go around yet continues instead of diverting to an alternate. The macho attitude expressed by the pilot would be "I am better than others and can make it"
                - **<u>Resignation</u>** - _"What is the use?"_
                    - EXAMPLE: A non-instrument-rated pilot continues into an area of known low visibility. The resignation attitude expressed by the pilot would be _"What is the use? No matter what I do, it won't end well"
    - In the ADM process, **the first step in neutralizing a hazardous attitude is recognizing it**
        - When you recognize a hazardous thought, **you should label it as hazardous; then correct the attitude by stating the corresponding antidote**
        - Hazardous attitudes, which contribute to poor pilot judgment, can be effectively counteracted by the appropriate antidote, as listed below
            - **Antiauthority** - **_"Follow the rules. They are usually right_**
            - **Impulsivity** - **_"Not so fast. Think first_**
            - **Invulnerability** - **_"It could happen to me_**
            - **Macho** - **_"Taking chances is foolish_**
            - **Resignation** - **_"I am not helpless. I can make a difference_**
    - **Stress** describes **_the body's response to a set of circumstances that induce a change in an individual's current physiological and/or psychological patterns of functioning, forcing the individual to adapt to these changes_** 
        - Success in reducing stress associated with crisis management on the flight deck **begins by making a personal assessment of stress in all areas of your life**
        - To help manage flight deck stress, you should try to relax and think rationally at the first sign of stress
    - The **DECIDE process** consists of six elements **to help provide a pilot with a logical way of approaching ADM**
        - **D**etect
        - **E**stimate
        - **C**hoose
        - **I**dentify
        - **D**o
        - **E**valuate
    - Once the **DECIDE** model completes, it will automatically restart in a cycle to determine the need for further action or change.
    - These elements represent a **_continuous-loop decision process_** that can be _used to assist a pilot in the decision-making process when faced with a change in a situation that requires judgment_
