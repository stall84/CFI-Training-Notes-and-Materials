## Teaching Risk Management Tools

1) **Risk Management** is a decision-making process designed to **systematically identify hazards, assess the degree of risk, and determine the best course of action associated with each flight**. This process relies on _situational awareness, problem identification, and good judgment to reduce the risks associated with each flight_.
    - **<u>Situational Awareness</u>** is defined as **the accurate perception and understanding of all the factors and conditions within the four fundamental risk elements that affect safety before, during, and after the flight**. Some obstacles to maintaining situational awareness include _fatigue, stress, and workload_.
- The **Pilot/Aircraft/enVironment/External pressures (PAVE)** checklist comprises **the <u>four aforementioned risk elements</u> in the ADM process**
    - This risk management tool allows pilots to assess any potential hazards before a flight:
        - **P**ilot (PIC) - **The pilot's fitness to fly must be evaluated, including _competency in the aircraft, currency, and flight experience_** _(I'd include [IMSAFE](../../AIH/ch1-risk-management-srm/index.md/#pic-imsafe))
        - **A**ircraft - **The aircraft _performance, limitations, equipment, and airworthiness_ must be determined**
        - en**V**ironment - **Factors such as weather and airport conditions (runway length, DA, etc) must be examined**
        - **E**xternal Pressures - **The _purpose of the flight_ is a factor that influences the pilot's decision to begin or continue the flight**
    - Risk management involves two broad steps: **risk assessment** and **risk mitigation**
        - **Every flight has hazards and some level of risk associated with it**. It is critical that pilots and especially learners are able to differentiate in advance between a low-risk flight and a high-risk flight and then establish a review process and develop risk mitigation strategies to address flights throughout that range
        - All identified risks should be addressed in proper risk management. **Risks must be either accepted or mitigated in some way**
            - Common mitigation strategies include taking along a more experienced pilot or flight instructor, delaying the flight, or canceling the flight altogether.
    - You and the mitigation process can be described as a **TEAM**
        - **T**ransfer - **_Shift risk, transfer responsibility, delegate, etc_**
        - **E**liminate - **_Remove risk entirely where possible_**
        - **A**ccept - **_Acknowledge manageable risks and proceed._**
        - **M**itigate - **_Reduce risk through proactivity_**

3) **Flight Risk Assessment Tools (FRATs)** provide pilots with straightforward ways to evaluate and visualize the risks associated with a flight
    - These easy-to-use methods of visually depicting risk allow for quick realization of the risk profile associated with a given flight
        - FRATs use structured scoring systems or graphical indicators to help pilots quickly assess whether a flight presents low, moderate, or high risk
            - This allows for informed, proactive, and efficient safety decisions
        - Numerical FRATs are intuitive risk management tools that align a fixed list of hazards with an assigned score typically gauged by severity
            - A low score will see the flight continue ass planned
            - A higher score will require active risk mitigation to validate the decision
    - By integrating FRATs into ADM and single-pilot resource management (SRM), pilots strengthen their ability to make data-driven, safety-conscious decisions
