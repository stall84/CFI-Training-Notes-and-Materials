## Teaching Risk Management Tools

1) **Risk Management** is a decision-making process designed to **systematically identify hazards, assess the degree of risk, and determine the best course of action associated with each flight**. This process relies on _situational awareness, problem identification, and good judgment to reduce the risks associated with each flight_.
    - **<u>Situational Awareness</u>** is defined as **the accurate perception and understanding of all the factors and conditions within the four fundamental risk elements that affect safety before, during, and after the flight**. Some obstacles to maintaining situational awareness include _fatigue, stress, and workload_.
- The **Pilot/Aircraft/enVironment/External pressures (PAVE)** checklist comprises **the <u>four aforementioned risk elements</u> in the ADM process**
    - This risk management tool allows pilots to assess any potential hazards before a flight:
        - **P**ilot (PIC) - **The pilot's fitness to fly must be evaluated, including _competency in the aircraft, currency, and flight experience_** _(I'd include [IMSAFE](../../AIH/ch1-risk-management-srm/index.md#pic-imsafe))
