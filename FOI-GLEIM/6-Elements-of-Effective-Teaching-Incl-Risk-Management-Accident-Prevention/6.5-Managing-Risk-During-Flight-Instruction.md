## Managing Risk During Flight Instruction

1) While the risk management techniques taught to learners remain the same, the instructional environment presents unique hazards that require additional awareness.
    - Utilize the **I AM RISK** technique when resulting risk _**can be identified, assessed, and mitigated**_
        - Instructors should 
            - Maintain core situational awareness of pertinent information, aircraft state, environmental conditions, operational factors, etc.
            - Recognize added and dynamic risk factors
                - **_The learner's experience level and decision-making ability_**
                - **_Their activity: the specific task performed and cognitive loading_**
                - **_Their intention: how actions align with expected outcome_**
2) **Common flight instruction risks can be analyzed by adapting the [PAVE checklist](../../PHAK/CH2-ADM/PAVE.md)  to enhance instructional decision making and risk assessment**
    - **P**ilot risks cover _**both qualifications and aeromedical considerations**_
    - **A**ircraft risks range from _**operational concerns to maintenance requirements**_
    - en**V**ironmental risks fluctuate due to **_weather, hazards, airspace complexity, and congestion_**
    - **E**xternal pressures created _**challenges for both instructors and learners, who may face conflicting schedules, differing motivations, and performance expectatinos**_
3) Best practices for managing risk during flight instruction **require a fully accountable instructor-learner collaboration**
    - The instructor, as a role model, should reinforce that both individuals share responsibility for risk management (maintaining a lookout and avoiding other air traffic, etc)
        - **Early training should engage learners to assist in monitoring aircraft airworthiness and addressing key environmental factors, such as airspace, NOTAMs, and TFRs _(and i'd argue knowing the weather METAR or AWOS before each flight)_**
4) Special considerations while teaching takeoffs and landings focus on the intense culmination of training efforts within a few critical seconds of execution
    - Instructors need to direct learners' potential anxiety toward positive action and reinforced safety.
    - <u>Teaching Takeoffs</u>
        - **Essential pretakeoff briefing covering the details**
            - Aircraft secured, runway entry headings, airspeeds, attitudes, visual references, flight control inputs, engine parameters, checklist usage, etc.
            - _Avoid distractions and hazards, limit teaching attempts during takeoff, preserve communications, and avoid learner overstimulation_
            - **Sterile flight deck environment where communications are concise and disciplined**
        - **Scenario-based training toward safety**
            - **Design realistic scenarios** mimicking real conditions **without introducing poor safety or negative habits**
            - **Avoid overzealous control input**, unsafe climb rates, or excessive pitch corrections
            - **Actively monitor runway drift in ground effect with fixed intervention points
        - **Risk awareness and spacing**
            - **Review wake turbulence avoiding procedures at all times**
            - Promote visual awareness of _traffic, spacing, separation, etc_
    - <u>Teaching Landings</u>
        - **_Conduct an essential before-landing briefing_**, following on from the earlier approach briefing
            - _**Emphasize the importance of knowing one's landing zone entirely _(airport knowledge, runway distance, etc)**_
            - Find runways that facilitate landing with winds relative to the training and phase of development
        - **Monitor slow-flight characteristics**
            - _**Discuss** the increased exposure to risk at this speed and altitude_
            - Ensure a healthy margin of safety is prioritized
        - **Anticipate learner error**
            - Landings can be challenging, and _**instructors must anticipate potential mistakes_ and guide corrective actions in advance**
            - **Reinforce adaptability, situational awareness, and risk mitigation to help learners build _decision-making skills_** suited to safe, confident landings
            - Unstable approaches must first be identifiable and then actively identified
