## Definitions of Learning

1) **Learning** can be defined as:
    - _The process of acquiring knowledge or skill through study, experience, or teaching_
    - A **change in behavior** as a result of experience and practice
    - The behavior changes can be **physical** and **overt** like hitting the touchdown-zone markers on a landing, or **attitudinal** or **intellectual** like a learner having more sensitive 'flying perceptions'.. the 'seat of the pants' feeling and intuition. 

2) Instructors possessing a clear definition of learning allows them to deeply _understand_:
    - Subject being taught
    - The Learner
    - The learning process and **interrelationships** that exist.
