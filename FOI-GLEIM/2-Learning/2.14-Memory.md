## Memory

1) At it's core, **memory serves as the bridge between a learner's ability to retain information and the higher cognitive process of effectively applying** what has been learned. 
    - Memory is an integral part of the learning process. It includes three parts: the **sensory register**, the **short-term (or working) memory**, and the **long-term memory**

2) **Sensory memory is the component of the memory system that captures, filters, and processes stimuli**
    - The **sensory register** receives initial input from the environment and quickly _processes it according to the individual's preconceived concept of what is important_, a process on the subconscious level.
    - **Precoding** is the selective process by which the sensory register _recognizes certain stimuli and immediately transmits them to the working memory for action_ Irrelevant stimuli are also discarded by the sensory register.
