## Memory

1) At it's core, **memory serves as the bridge between a learner's ability to retain information and the higher cognitive process of effectively applying** what has been learned. 
    - Memory is an integral part of the learning process. It includes three parts: the **sensory register**, the **short-term (or working) memory**, and the **long-term memory**

2) **Sensory memory is the component of the memory system that captures, filters, and processes stimuli**
    - The <a id="sensory-register"></a>**sensory register** receives initial input from the environment and quickly _processes it according to the individual's preconceived concept of what is important_, a process on the subconscious level.
    - **Precoding** is the selective process by which the sensory register _recognizes certain stimuli and immediately transmits them to the working memory for action_ Irrelevant stimuli are also discarded by the sensory register.
3) The **short-term memory (STM)**, or _working memory_, is the receptacle of the information deemed important by the _sensory register_.
    - A key limitation of STM is that _it takes 5-10 seconds to properly code information_. If the coding process is interrupted, that information is easily lost because it is stored for only 30 seconds. **The purpose of STM is to put information to immediate use**.
    - The information may temporarily remain in the short-term memory, or it may rapidly fade. Retention of information by the short-term memory is aided when the information is initially categorized into systematic chunks in a process known as **coding**. Retention is also aided by repetition or rehearsal of the information [(rote learning)](./2.6-Domains-of-Learning.md#rote-learning)
