## Acquiring Knowledge

1) Part of an aviation instructor's job is helping learners acquire knowledge.
    - Here, **knowledge** refers to _information_ that humans are consciously aware of and can articulate.

2) **Memorization**, **Understanding**, and **Concept Learning**, are phases of cognitive learning and knowledge acquisition.
    - **Memorization**: The initial phase, when information is stored for recall.
    - **Understanding**: The second phase, this is when memorized information is processed to recognize _patterns_, _relationships_, and _meaning_.
    - **Concept Learning**: The final phase, when knowledge is applied in broader contexts, enabling problem solving, adaptability, and creative thinking.
