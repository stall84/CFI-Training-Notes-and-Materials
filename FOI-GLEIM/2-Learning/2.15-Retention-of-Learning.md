## Retention of Learning

1) The [Theories of forgetting](../2-Learning/2.14-Memory.md#forgetting) described earlier imply that when something is forgotten by a learner, _it is not actually lost. It is simply unavailable for recall_.
    - Instructors should **teach thoroughly and with meaning**
        - Any material that is thoroughly learned is _highly resistant to forgetting_.
    - Instructors should provide **meaningful learning**
        - Building patterns of relationships in the learner's consciousness. This can be _heavily reinforced when using [SBT](../2-Learning/2.8-Scenario-Based-Training.md) . In contrast rote learning is superficial and is not easily retained_.
        - Deepens learning because _it involves principles and concepts anchored in the learner's own experiences_.
