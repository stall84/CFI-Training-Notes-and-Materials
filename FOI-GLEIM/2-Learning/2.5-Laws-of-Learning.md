## Laws of Learning

1) The "laws of learning" that apply to the learning process are fundamental principles that help shape effective teaching and learning experiences.
2) The laws of learning provide insight into effective teaching and learning experiences.
    - The **principle of readiness** states that if a learner is ready to learn and has a strong purpose and clear objective, with a well-fixed reason for learning, they will make more progress than if they lack motivation. Readiness implies _single-mindedness_
        - Readiness to learn also involves what is called the _"teachable moment"_, a moment of educational opportunity when a person is particularly responsive to being taught something. 
    - The **principle of exercise** states that those things most often repeated are best remembered or performed.
        - The basis of this principle is to provide opportunities for a learner to practice and then direct this process toward a goal.
        - Connections are strengthened with practice and weakened when practice is discontinued, reflecting the adage "use it or lose it."
