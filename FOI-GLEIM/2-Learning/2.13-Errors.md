## Errors

1) Instructors and learners are vulnerable to occasional errors that naturally occur as a byproduct of human performance. An understanding of errors provides insight into how they can be minimized.
    - There are two main types of **error**:
        - **Mistakes** occur when an individual **plans to do the incorrect thing** and is successful. _(this is a little wonky of a definition, but if you consider the context of saying the phrase "I just made a mistake", it makes it a little more sense)_. Mistakes are _errors of thought and are sometimes the result of gaps or misconceptions in the learner's understanding_.
        - **Slips** occur when an individual **plans to do one thing but inadvertently does something else**. Slips are errors of action and are sometimes the result of neglect or confusion.
    - Ways to reduce errors:
        - **Learning and practice** are the best tools against errors, and higher skill and knowledge levels are associated with lower error occurrence. 
        - **Taking time** to work deliberately at a comfortable pace can mitigate errors.
        - **Checking for errors** to catch potential errors, is critical.
        - **Using reminders** such as checklists can reduce the potential for errors.
        - **Developing routines** or standardized procedures can significantly reduce error occurrence.
        - **Raising awareness** of the environment can reduce susceptibility to error.
