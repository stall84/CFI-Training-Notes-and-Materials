## Evaluation Versus Critique

1) During the initial stages of skill acquisition, _practical suggestions provide more value to a learner_ than a grade.
    - Early evaluations are typically instructor-oriented during this period, which provides a check and balance on teaching effectiveness.
        - The evaluation (which are a prerequisite for making constructive criticism) can 
            - Be used to predict learner outcomes
            - Help target special problem areas
            - Identify learner strengths and weaknesses
    - As a learner practices a skill toward proficiency
        - The learner must perform the practiced skill correctly 
        - The instructor must monitor the practice and provide feedback about the skill development.
    - Monitoring the performance benefits the learner by
        - Providing constructive criticism to help eliminate errors
        - Providing compliments on aspects of the skill performed correctly, helping keep the evaluation positive
        - Allowing learner to self-critique performance, enhancing learner-centered training.
