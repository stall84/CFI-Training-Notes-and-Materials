## Learning Theory as it Applies to Ground and Flight Instruction

1) Learning theory helps to _explain the acquisition of skills, knowledge, and attitudes_.
    - Primary learning theories include:
        1) **Classical Conditioning**
            - Learning that occurs when a **neutral stimulus** like a stall horn (which by itself has no meaining at all) is **repeatedly paired with** a **natural stimulus** (the aerodynamic stall, something to be avoided / feared) which over time produces a **conditioned stimulus** for the pilot who now associates the stall horn with an impending aerodynamic stall. 
        2) **Operant Conditioning**
            - Similar to Classical Conditioning, except the association is made between the **behavior** and it's **consequences** or **outcome**. 
            - Through operant conditioning, a pilot learns that correct actions such as maintaining proper angle of attack or executing proper stall recovery techniques lead to positive outcomes like avoiding loss of control, minimizing altitude loss, and receiving instructor reinforcement.
        3) **Social Learning**
            - Learning is **done by observation** (4 stages listed below)
                - **Attention**: The learner's ability to pay attention to others around them in order to learn.
                - **Retention**: The ability to repeat a behavior that was once before (or more) observed.
                - **Reproduction**: The act of reproducing a previously observed behavior.
                - **Motivation**: The reason behind a learner reproducing an observed behavior.

2) **Behaviorism** explains human behavior entirely in terms of observable and measurable responses to stimuli
