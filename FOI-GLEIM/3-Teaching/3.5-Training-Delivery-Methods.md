## Training Delivery Methods

1) The modern training environment offers a host of presentation opportunities.
    - Effective instructors utilize the following methods by which conveys the information in the most effective situation.

2) **Lecture** methodology involves an instructor addressing a group of learners, who typically engage as mostly _silent participants_.
    - The _lecture_ is used primarily for:
        - _Introducing learners to new subject material_
        - _Summarizing ideas_
        - _Showing relationships between theory and practice_
        - _Reemphasizing main points_
    - Four types of _lecture_ methods:
        - The **illustrated talk**: in which the speaker relies heavily on visual aids to convey their ideas to the listeners
        - The **briefing** which the speaker presents a concise array of facts to the listeners, who do not expect elaboration or supporting material
        - The **formal speech**: which the speaker's purpose is to inform, persuade, or entertain
        - The **teaching lecture**: which the instructor must plan and deliver an oral presentation in a manner that helps the learners reach the desired learning outcomes.
    - One _advantage_ of a _teaching lecture_ is that the instructor can present _many_ ideas in a relatively _short time_. Facts and ideas that have been logically organized can be concisely presented in rapid sequence. 
        - Thus, a teaching lecture is the most _economical_ of all teaching methods in terms of the time required to present a given amount of material. 
    - One _disadvantage_ of a teaching lecture is that the instructor does not receive a direct _reaction (either words or actions)_ from the learners. 
        - Thus, the instructor must develop a keen perception for subtle responses from the class and must be able to interpret the meaning of these indirect reactions and adjust lessons accordingly. These reactions could be in the form of _facial expressions_, _manner of taking notes_, and _apparent interest or lack thereof_ in the lesson.
        - The instructor must recognize that **the lecture method is _least useful for evaluating learner performance_**.
