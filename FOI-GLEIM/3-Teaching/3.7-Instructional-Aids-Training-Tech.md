## Instructional Aids and Training Technologies

1) Instructional aids and training technologies are useful tools that **emphasize, support, supplement, or reinforce** the key points or concepts in a lesson and assist an instructor in the teaching-learning process.
    - Instructional aids include _models_, _chalkboards_, _charts_, and _digitally presented materials_ (e.g. multimedia, movies, graphics, slides, etc)
    - **Instructional aids can help instructors to teach more and more in a smaller time frame**.
    - Good instructional aids should provide an accurate visual image and make learning easier.
        - They can also help **solve certain language barrier problems**.

2) **Characteristics** of effective instructional aids are
    - **Simplicity**
        - Easy to understand, not overwhelming
    - **Accuracy**
        - Precise and accurate for clarity
    - **Relevance**
        - Directly related to the content
    - **Cost-effectiveness**
        - Efficient and budget friendly

3) Reasons for the use of instructional aids are many, so long as the aid does not become a distraction.
    - They include the following:
        - **Helping learners remember important information**
        - **Gaining and holding learner attention**
        - **Clarifying the relationship between material _objects_ and _concepts_**
        - **Assisting in solving language barriers**
        - **Giving support when topics involve the use of more senses (i.e. sight, hearing, or a combination of others)**

4) Guidelines for use of any instructional aid should be _planned_, based on its ability to _support a specific point in a lesson_
    - The following four-step procedure should be used to determine if and when instructional aids are necessary:
        - **Clearly establish the lesson objective**, being certain what must be communicated
        - **Gather the necessary data by researching for support material**
        - **Organize the material into an outline or lesson plan**. The outline should include all key points to be presented
        - **Finally, determine what ideas should be supported with instructional aids** They should be:
            - Compatible with the learning outcomes to be achieved
            - Designed to cover the key points in a lesson
            - Visible throughout the lesson
        
    - Instructional aids used in the teaching/learning process **should not be used as a crutch by the instructor**

5) Types of instructional aids include **marker boards and supplemental print materials, including charts, diagrams, and graphs**
    - Other aids include projected material, video, computer-based programs, models, mock-ups, or cut-aways
    - Interactive video is a type of computer software that responds quickly to certain choices and commands by the user.
        - The questions or directions are programmed using a branching technique, which provides several possible courses of action for the user to choose in order to move from one sequence to another.
