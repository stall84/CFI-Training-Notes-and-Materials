## Integrated Flight Instruction

1) **Integrated Flight Instruction**: **When learners are taught to perform flight maneuvers, both by _outside visual references_ and by _inside reference to flight instruments_ for the same operations**
    - As an instructor, **your primary goal is safety**. You must develop the habit of **constantly monitoring the learner's performance and the aircraft's performance** while **maintaining an appropriate scan for traffic**
        - For this type of instruction to be fully effective, **the use of instrument references should begin the first time each new maneuver is introduced** 
        - It is also important for the learner to learn the feel of the aircraft while conducting maneuvers
            - EXAMPLE Determining, by feeling, that the aircraft is out of trim or in an unusual attitude. _(Or, get them to feel the classic slow flight burbling or buffeting)_
        - Learners who have been taught by means of integrated flight instruction _will develop the habit of continuously monitoring both their own performance and that of the aircraft_. 
    - The habitual attention to instrument indications leads to improved pilot competency, operating efficiency of the aircraft, and overall increase in safety.
        - EXAMPLE: Landings will be improved due to more precise airspeed control, and average cruising flight performance increases by holding precise headings and altitudes
        - The ability to fly in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) _is not the objective of this type of primary training_ yet it will provide _a good foundation for later training for an instrument rating_.
    - During the conduct of integrated flight instruction, **you are responsible for collision avoidance while the learner is flying by simulated instruments**, i.e. 'under the hood'
        - You must guard against diverting your attention to the learner's performance for extended periods.
    - At the same time, **you must be sure that the learner develops, from the first lesson, the habit of looking for other traffic when they are not operating under simulated instrument conditions**.
        - Any observed tendency of a learner to enter a maneuver without clearing the area **must be corrected immediately**
