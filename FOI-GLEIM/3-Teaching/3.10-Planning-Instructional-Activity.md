## Planning Instructional Activity

1) An instructor must plan instructional activity around a _structured series of lessons_ where each ground or flight event is a continuation of an integrated training process.
    - Each instructional activity requires the instructor plan the event provided for the learner to the same extent as the learner prepares for it. 

2) **Blocks of learning** follow along once the instructor establishes the overall training objectives
    - They must:
        - **Identify** the blocks of learning that **make up the necessary parts of the total objective**
        - **Ensure** that each block of learning identified is **truly an integral part of the overall objective**
            - Blocks of learning should represent **units of learning that can be _measured_ and _evaluated_**
            - Extraneous blocks of instruction are expensive frills, especially in flight instruction, and detract from the completion of the final objective
            - EXAMPLE: A learner is preparing for their first solo flight, and the instructor starts teaching about cross-country procedures _(extraneous)_
        - The blocks of learning **must be developed and arranged in their proper sequence**
            - In this way, **a learner can master the segments of the overall pilot performance requirements individually and can progressively combine these with other related segments until their sum meets the final objective**
        - Learners will master segments of blocks individually and can progressively combine these with other related segments until the overall training objectives are reached.
            - EXAMPLE: Flight training may be divided into the following major blocks: **1) Achievement of the knowledge and skills necessary for solo flight**, **2) Achievement of the knowledge and skills necessary for solo cross-country flight**, and **3) Achievement of the knowledge and skills appropriate for achieving a private pilot certificate**
        - Using this approach **provides the learner with a boost of self-confidence as each block is successfully completed** _(and not just appearing to aimlessly wander through ever complex material)_

3) A **training syllabus** is a practical guide to help instructors make sure that training is accomplished in a logical sequence, where all requirements are completed and properly documented. 
    - A training syllabus is an _abstract_ or _digest_ of the course of training. It consists of the blocks of learning to be completed in the most efficient order.
        - All syllabi **should stress well-defined objectives, content, and completion standards for each lesson**
        - The order of training can and _should be altered when necessary to suit the progress of the learner and the demands of special circumstances_, such as weather conditions
        - However it is often preferable to skip to a completely different part of the syllabus when the conduct of a scheduled lesson is impossible, rather than proceeding to the next lesson, which may be predicated completely on skills to be developed during the lesson being postponed.
        - EXAMPLE: If a learner is having a difficult time with normal approach and landings, it might be wise for the instructor to skip the next proposed lesson on short field landings and instead review another area of training. This would enable the learner to gain confidence and reinforce skills needed to perform normal landings.

4) **Lesson Plans** are organized outlines developed for a single instructional period. 
    - Each **lesson** of the **training syllabus** includes an **objective, content, and completion standards**
        - A properly constructed lesson plan will provide an outline that tells the instructor what to do, in what order to do it, and what teaching procedure to use.
            - The lesson plan **must be appropriate for the particular learner**. 
                - **Standard** lesson plans **may not be effective for learners requiring a different approach**
                - Therefore, the main concern in developing a lesson plan is the learner
