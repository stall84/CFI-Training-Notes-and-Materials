## Planning Instructional Activity

1) An instructor must plan instructional activity around a _structured series of lessons_ where each ground or flight event is a continuation of an integrated training process.
    - Each instructional activity requires the instructor plan the event provided for the learner to the same extent as the learner prepares for it. 

2) **Blocks of learning** follow along once the instructor establishes the overall training objectives
    - They must:
        - **Identify** the blocks of learning that **make up the necessary parts of the total objective**
        - **Ensure** that each block of learning identified is **truly an integral part of the overall objective**
            - Blocks of learning should represent **units of learning that can be _measured_ and _evaluated_**
            - Extraneous blocks of instruction are expensive frills, especially in flight instruction, and detract from the completion of the final objective
            - EXAMPLE: A learner is preparing for their first solo flight, and the instructor starts teaching about cross-country procedures _(extraneous)_
        - The blocks of learning **must be developed and arranged in their proper sequence**
            - In this way, **a learner can master the segments of the overall pilot performance requirements individually and can progressively combine these with other related segments until their sum meets the final objective**
        - Learners will master segments of blocks individually and can progressively combine these with other related segments until the overall training objectives are reached.
            - EXAMPLE: Flight training may be divided into the following major blocks: **1) Achievement of the knowledge and skills necessary for solo flight**, **2) Achievement of the knowledge and skills necessary for solo cross-country flight**, and **3) Achievement of the knowledge and skills appropriate for achieving a private pilot certificate**
        - Using this approach **provides the learner with a boost of self-confidence as each block is successfully completed** _(and not just appearing to aimlessly wander through ever complex material)_
