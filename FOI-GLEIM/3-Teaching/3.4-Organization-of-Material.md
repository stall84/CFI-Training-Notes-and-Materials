## Organization of Material

1) Once a determination of objectives and standards has been made, an instructor must formulate a plan of action to lead learners through the course in a logical manner toward the desired goal. One effective way to organize a lesson is by introduction, development, and conclusion _(A similar pattern to constructing an argumentative paper/essay)_
    - The **introduction** sets the stage for everything to come. The introduction can be divided into three subparts:
        - **Attention**: The instructor must gain each learner's attention and focus it on the subject.
            - EXAMPLE: Stories, video clips, questions, or jokes can be used to gain learner attention. _(Think like a quick personal flight experience story)_
