## Preparation of a Lesson

1) Whether using a self-developed or commercially available syllabus, the instructor's preparation **begins by determining training _objectives and standards_ before instruction.**

2) Training objectives and completion standards _bookend the learning process defining both the starting point and the expected proficiency level at the end of instruction_
    - **Performance-based objectives** _help define what needs to be done in a given lesson_.
        - Instructor's can shift training focus as the learner develops toward decision-based objectives.
    - **Decision-based objectives** rely on a more _dynamic learning environment where learners develop critical thinking skills_.
