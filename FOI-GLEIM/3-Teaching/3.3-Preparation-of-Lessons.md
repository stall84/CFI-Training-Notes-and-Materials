## Preparation of a Lesson

1) Whether using a self-developed or commercially available syllabus, the instructor's preparation **begins by determining training _objectives and standards_ before instruction.**

2) Training objectives and completion standards _bookend the learning process defining both the starting point and the expected proficiency level at the end of instruction_
    - **Performance-based objectives** _help define what needs to be done in a given lesson_.
        - Instructor's can shift training focus as the learner develops toward decision-based objectives.
    - **Decision-based objectives** rely on a more _dynamic learning environment where learners develop critical thinking skills_.
    - These two types of objectives (above) apply across all three domains of learning (cognitive, affective, and  psychomotor, discussed in [Study Unit 2.6](../2-Learning/2.6-Domains-of-Learning.md)) and each objective should incorporate the desired level of learning.
        - Instructors should adapt training objectives to a specific level of knowledge or skill. 
        - Defined training objectives must be clear to the learner.
    - The objectives guide the completion standards and include descriptions of the following:
        - **Desired knowledge**
        - **Behavior**
        - **Stated skill in specific terms**
        - **Associated conditions and criteria**
    - _Cognitive and psychomotor completion standards can be straightforward to evaluate_, but the _affective domain standards can be harder to decode (attitudes, beliefs, and values)_

3) **Performance-based objectives** are used to set _measurable_, _reasonable_ standards that describe the required learner performance.
    - They provide a way of stating what performance level is desired of a learner before progressing to the next stage of instruction. 
    - Written objectives are _clear_, _measurable_, and _repeatable_. 
    - These objectives consist of three elements: _description of the skill or behavior_, _conditions_, and _criteria_.
