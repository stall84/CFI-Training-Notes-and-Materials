## Problem Based Learning

1) **Problem Based Learning (PBL)** describes a type of learning environment in which lessons are structured to confront learners with problems encountered in real life that force them to reach real-world solutions.
    - A characteristic of PBL is **that there is no _single_ solution to the given problem**
        - These types of 'authentic' problems allow the learner to 'make meaning' of the information based on **past experience and personal interpretation**
    - Benefits of PBL include **helping the learner gain a deeper understanding of the information**. Learners will also **improve their ability to recall information** in this type of learning
    - Effective PBL problems **motivate**, **focus**, and **initiate learning**, and
        - _Relate to the real world, stimulating learner desire to solve them_
        - _Require learners to make decisions_
        - _Are open-ended and not limited to one correct answer_
        - _Are connected both to previously learned and new knowledge_
        - _Reflect the lesson objective(s)_
        - _Challenge them to think critically_
    - **PBL promotes higher order thinking skills (HOTS)**. An instructor should incorporate _analysis_, _synthesis_, and _evaluation_ into PBL lessons.
        - Teaching HOTS involves the cognitive skills needed in making decisions and judgments effectively. It should be taught throughout the curriculum from simple to complex and from concrete to abstract with the following approach:
            - **Set up the problem**
            - **Determine learning outcomes for the problem**
            - **Solve the problem or task**
            - **Reflect on the problem-solving process**
            - **Consider additional solutions through guided discovery**
            - **Reevaluate the solution with additional options**
            - **Reflect on this solution and why it could be the best solution**
            - **Consider what "best" means (Is it situational?)**

2) The three types of problem-based instruction are **scenario-based training (SBT)**, the **collaborative problem-solving method**, and the **case study method**.
    - **Scenario Based Training (SBT) Method**: 
        - SBT is **a realistic situation that allows the learner to rehearse mentally for a situation and requires practical application of various pieces of knowledge**
            - Scenarios often describe a story beginning with a reason to fly because a pilot's decisions may differ depending on the motivation to fly _(Is this a medical evacuation or a casual Sunday fishing trip?)_
        - SBT scenarios **challenge learners to manage available resources, exercise sound judgment, and make timely decisions with the goal of reducing accidents**. The overall learning objective is for the learner to be more prepared to make good decisions based on a variety of real-world situations.
        - **SBT is a powerful tool because the future is unpredictable**, and there is no way to train a pilot for _every combination of events they may encounter_
        - A good scenario:
            - **Is not a test**
            - **Will not have only one correct answer**
            - **Does not offer an obvious answer**
            - **Should not promote errors**
            - **Should promote situational awareness and opportunities for decision making**
        - EXAMPLE: "A newly rated private pilot is heading out on a cross-country flight to see his son graduate from college. He has already gotten a late start because of poor weather at his home field. Halfway through his flight he encounters low visibility and increased turbulence. ATC and AWOS both confirm the weather is IMC at his destination airport and several others nearby. What will he do now?"
    - **Collaborative Problem Solving Method**
        - The collaborative problem-solving method **combines collaboration with problem solving when the instructor provides a problem to _a group of two or more people working together_ who then solve the problem**
        - This type of instruction is similar to SBT in that it includes open ended 'what if?' questions.
    - **Case Study Method**
        - This method **uses a written or oral account of a real-world situation that contains an educational message for the learner**
            - The instructor presents the case to the learners who then _analyze it_, _reach conclusions_, and _offer possible solutions_. Case studies require learners to use critical thinking skills.
        - A good resource for source material for the creation of case studies can be found at the National Transportation Safety Board's (NTSB) website.
            - The flight instructor will have the learner analyze the information and suggest possible reasons for the accident. **This analysis will both _reinforce positive decision-making skills_ and provide the learner with _the consequences of improper decision making_**
    - **Operational pitfalls** are classic behavioral traps that can ensnare the unwary pilot. **Pilots, particularly those with considerable experience, try to complete a flight as planned, please passengers, and meet schedules**. This basic drive to demonstrate achievements **can have an adverse effect on safety**. 
        - **These tendencies ultimately may lead to practices that are dangerous and sometimes illegal**
            - Learners develop awareness and learn to avoid many of these operational pitfalls **_through effective ADM training_**. **The scenarios and examples provided by instructors during ADM instruction should involve these pitfalls**
        - **_Lack of effective ADM training_** may lead to **overconfidence, disregard for applicable regulations, or disregard of flight planning**.
            - An overconfident pilot may not properly plan for minimum fuel reserves during preflight planning or may neglect the preflight plan altogether.
