## Professional Development

1) Instructors undergo comprehensive evaluations and a practical test to obtain certification and **need to continue to develop their knowledge and skills in order to teach successfully in this environment**
    - Successful, professional aviation instructors do not become _complacent_ or satisfied with their own qualifications and abilities and are constantly alert for ways to improve their qualifications, effectiveness, and the services they provide to learners.
    - An instructor **who is not _completely familiar with current pilot certification and rating requirements_ cannot do a competent job of flight instruction**
        - Flight instructors must strive to maintain the highest level of knowledge, training, and currency in their field. 
        - For a professional performance as a flight instructor, it is essential that the instructor maintain and evolve their instructional library.
        - True performance as a professional is based on study and research

        - More importantly, **such deficiencies may in themselves allow hazardous inadequacies to develop in the learner's ongoing piloting performance**
    - Instructors should be constantly alert for ways to improve the services they provide to their learners, their effectiveness, and their qualifications
        - A professional aviation instructor continually updates their knowledge and skills
            - This goal can be attained through _self-study_ and a commitment to lifelong learning
                - Regularly review and adapt to Administrator output _(AC's)_

                - Experiment with emergent technologies
                - Engage with aviation communities
                - Maintain flight proficiency with hands-on experience
                - Explore continued education and advancement
