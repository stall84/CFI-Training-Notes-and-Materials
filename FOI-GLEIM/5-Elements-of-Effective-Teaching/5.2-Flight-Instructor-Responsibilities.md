## Flight Instructor Responsibilities 

1) A flight instructor is responsible for developing and evaluating a learner while molding them into a safe pilot who brings a professional approach to their flying.
    - An **instructor is responsible** for _conveying_:
        - **How pilot standards are set**
        - **How learners are trained to meet them**
        - **That meeting a set standard provides a limited margin of safety**
    - It is a flight instructor's responsibility to 
        - <u>**Empower the learner to take charge during a flight**</u>
            - **A pilot in command (PIC) must know when to tell any passengers, even a designated pilot examiner (DPE), when the PIC finds actions in the aircraft that distract and interfere with the safe conduct of the flight**
            - Instructor responsibilities include **teaching the learner to divide their attention between distracting tasks and maintaining control of the aircraft**
            - **Properly interjected distractions** may help learners learn to _determine whether a distraction warrants further attention or action on their part_
        - Assign goals
            - Goals the learner considers difficult but possible usually provide a challenge and promote learning.
            - In a typical flight lesson, reasonable goals are listed in the lesson objectives, and the desired levels of proficiency for the goals are included in statements that contain completion standards
        - Engage learners
            - Learners will remain engaged if aware of the progress they are making
                - Repeat a demonstration or example and show them the standards their performance must ultimately meet
    - Flight instructors have a **particular responsibility to provide guidance and restraint regarding the solo operations of their learners**
        - Before receiving a solo flight endorsement, **a learner should be required to demonstrate the consistent ability to perform all of the fundamental maneuvers without the need of instructor assistance**
        - The learner should also be capable of handling ordinary problems that might occur, such as traffic pattern congestion, a change in the active runway, or unexpected crosswinds
    - Additional responsibilities of flight instructors include
        - Evaluation of learner piloting ability
        - Pilot supervision
        - Practical test recommendations
        - Flight instructor endorsements
            - Examples of all common endorsements can be found in the current issue of [AC 61-65 Appendix A](https://www.faa.gov/documentlibrary/media/advisory_circular/ac_61-65h.pdf)
        - Additional training and endorsements
        - Pilot proficiency
        - See-and-avoid responsibility
        - Learner's pre-solo flight thought process
            - The learner needs to show consistency in the required solo tasks before attempting the first solo flight
