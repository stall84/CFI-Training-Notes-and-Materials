## Flight Instructor Qualifications and Professionalism

1) Although the term _"professionalism"_ is widely used, it is rarely defined. In fact, no single definition can encompass all of the qualifications and considerations of true professionalism.
    - The following are some of the major considerations:
        - Professionals **must be able to reason logically and accurately**
        - Professionals **commit themselves to continuous learning and development**
            - Professionals **cannot limit actions and decisions to standard patterns and practice**
            - Professionals **commit themselves to continuous learning and development**
        - Professionalism demands a code of ethics
    - The professional flight instructor **should be straightforward and honest**
        - Anything less than a sincere performance is quickly detected and immediately destroys instructor effectiveness
        - Learner confidence tends **to be destroyed if instructors _bluff_ when in doubt**
        - The well-prepared instructor **instills not only confidence but also good habits because preparing well for a flight is a basic requirement for safe flying**. Learners quickly become apathetic when they recognize that their flight instructor is inadequately prepared
    - The **_attitude_, _movements_, and _general demeanor_ of the flight instructor contribute a great deal to their professional image**
        - The instructor **should avoid** _erratic movements_, _distracting speech habits_, and _**capricious changes in mood**_. **The professional image requires development of a calm, pleasant, thoughtful manner that puts the learner at ease**
    - The professional relationship between the instructor and the learner should be based on a mutual acknowledgement that both the learner and the instructor are important to each other and that both are working toward the same objective
        - Accepting lower-than-normal standards to please a learner _**will not**_ help the learner-instructor relationship _(don't pander to the paying student)_
        - Reasonable standards strictly enforced are not resented by an earnest learner
        - _Learners must be treated with respect_, regardless of whether they are quick to learn or require more time to absorb certain concepts 
    - The professional flight instructor should **accept learners as they are with all of their faults and problems**
        - However, they should also **build learner self-confidence, set challenges, and generally create an atmosphere for learning**
