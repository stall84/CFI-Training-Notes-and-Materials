## Human Factors and Human Behavior

### Human Factors
- A term that covers the science of understanding the properties ofhuman capability, and the application of this understanding.
- Applying the knowledge gained from studying human capabilities has lead to and continues to advance machine design (like planes), information systems (like radio communication), tools (for maintenance), etc. 

### Human Behaviors
- The FAA oversaw an extensive research study on the similarities and dissimilarities of accident-free pilots and those who were not (4000 pilots used).
- The pilots in the study that had already been involved in an aviation accident in the past exhibited the following characteristics: 
    - Have disdain toward rules
    - Have very high correlation between accidents on their flying records and safety violations on their driving records
    - Frequently fall into the “thrill and adventure seeking” personality category
    - Are impulsive rather than methodical and disciplined, both in their information gathering and in the speed and selection of actions to be taken
    - Have a disregard for or tend to under utilize outside sources of information, including copilots, flight attendants, flight service personnel, flight instructors, and ATC
