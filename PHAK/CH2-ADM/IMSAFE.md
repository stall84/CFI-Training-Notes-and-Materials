## IMSAFE Pilot Inventory/Checklist 
- **Used to assess a pilot's physical and mental readiness for flying, a critical part of risk assesment (and mitigation/reduction)**
### I - Illness
- Determine if you are suffering from or recovering from an _**illness**_ or _**injury**_
- Ask _'Am I Sick?'_ (cold, flu, sweats/chills), or _'Am I injured?'_ (broken toe/foot)
- Illness or injury are obvious high risk factors to pilot capability in flight. 
### M - Medication
- Determine if any over the counter or prescription medication is being taken that can affexct pilot performance.
- List of FAA OTC medication warnings and a determination matrix [can be found here](https://www.faa.gov/pilots/medical_certification/media/OTCMedicationsforPilots.pdf)
- Obviously medication, especially if sedating or drowsiness-inducing can cause severe pilot performance problems. 
### S - Stress
- Determine levels of _**accute**_ and/or _**chronic**_ stress levels
- Ask: _'Am I under psychological pressure from the job?'_ & _'Do I have money, health, or family problems?'_
- Stress can often be an overlooked or underrated contributor to pilot performance. 
### A - Alcohol
- 8 hours minimum 'Bottle to Throttle' and maximum 0.04% BAV
- Clearly can have catastrophic effects on pilot performance and can enhance the detrimental effects of the other parts of this checklist.
### F - Fatigue
- Fatigue can also be _**accute**_ or _**chronic**_. For instance a pilot could regularly have sleep problems or not be getting enough sleep every night, or it could be a one-time 'all-nighter' accute scenario. 
- Ask _'Am I tired and not adequately rested?'_
- Fatigue can insidiously creep in to all parts of a pilot's decision making and create catastrophic effects.
### E - Emotions
- Ask _'Am I emotionally upset?'_ 
- Like other parts of this checklist an emotional upset or off-nominal state can lead to imperceptable bad decisions that lead to a catastrophic outcome.
