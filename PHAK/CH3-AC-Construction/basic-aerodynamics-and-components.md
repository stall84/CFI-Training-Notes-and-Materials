## Basic Aerodynamics and AC Components 
- Note: More detailed aerodynamic discussion in Chapter 5, this is just to set foundation to discuss components and construction

### Four Forces of Flight
- **Lift :** _The force that opposes the downward force of weight, is produced by the dynamic effect of the air acting on the wing, and acts perpendicular to the flight path through the wing’s center of lift (CL)._
- **Thrust :** _The forward force produced by the powerplant/propeller. It opposes or overcomes the force of drag. As a general rule, it is said to act parallel to the longitudinal axis (not always the case, but adequately illustrative)._
- **Drag :** _The rearward, retarding force that is caused by disruption of airflow by the wing, fuselage, and other protruding objects. Drag opposes thrust and acts rearward parallel to the relative wind._
- **Weight :** _The combined load of the aircraft itself, the crew, the fuel, and the cargo or baggage. Weight pulls the aircraft downward because of the force of gravity. It opposes lift and acts vertically downward through the aircraft’s center of gravity (CG)._

### Major Components of Airframe (Airplane)
- **Fuselage**: The section enclosing the occupants, cargo, and cockpit, etc.
- **Wings**: Airfoils attached to sides of fuselage.
- **Empenage**: Tail assembly structure. 
- **Landing Gear**: Primary support system on ground
- **Powerplant**: (in small craft) The engine and propeller

### Types of Aircraft Construction
- **Truss Structure**: In this construction method, lengths of tubing, called longerons, are welded in place to form a well braced framework. Vertical and horizontal struts are welded to the longerons and give the structure a square or rectangular shape when viewed from the end. The [**Piper J-3 Cub**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piper_J-3_Cub) is a perfect example of a truss airframe.
- **Monocoque**: Monocoque construction uses stressed skin to support almost all loads much like an aluminum beverage can. Although very strong, monocoque construction is not highly tolerant to deformation of the surface (think like an aluminum can). _Because most twisting and bending stresses are carried by the external skin rather than by an open framework, the need for internal bracing was eliminated or reduced, saving weight and maximizing space._
- **Semimonocoque**: Semimonocoque construction, partial or one-half, uses a substructure to which the airplane’s skin is attached. The substructure, which consists of bulkheads and/or formers of various sizes and stringers, reinforces the stressed skin by taking some of the bending stress from the fuselage. 
- **Composite Construction**: Composite is a broad term and can mean materials such as fiberglass, carbon-fiber cloth, Kevlar™ cloth, and mixtures of all of the above. Composite construction offers two advantages: extremely smooth skins and the ability to easily form complex curved or streamlined structures. _Composite construction offers several advantages over metal, wood, or fabric, with its lighter weight being the most frequently cited. A more important advantage is that a very smooth, compound curved, aerodynamic structure made from composites reduces drag._ _**Disadvantages include damage not being immediately or obviously visible. internal damage from stress, etc might show no indication at the surface to maintenance or a pilot doing a walk around. Heat damage considerations are also more important with composites with some epoxies degrading at just 150F (easily attained on a black asphalt ramp in summer)**_

### Instrumentation in Construction
- Until recently, most GA aircraft were equipped with individual instruments utilized collectively to safely operate and maneuver the aircraft. With the release of the electronic flight display (EFD) system, conventional instruments have been replaced by multiple liquid crystal display (LCD) screens.
- **Performance Instruments**: The performance instruments indicate the aircraft’s actual performance. Performance is determined by reference to the _**altimeter**_, _**airspeed or vertical speed indicator (VSI)**_, _**heading indicator**_, and _**turn-and-slip indicator**_. The performance instruments directly reflect the performance the aircraft is achieving. The speed of the aircraft can be referenced on the airspeed indicator. The altitude can be referenced on the altimeter. The aircraft’s climb performance can be determined by referencing the VSI. Other performance instruments available are the heading indicator, angle of attack indicator, and the slip-skid indicator.
- **Control Instruments**: The control instruments display immediate attitude and power changes and are calibrated to permit adjustments in precise increments. The instrument for attitude display is the _**attitude indicator**_.
- **Navigation Instruments**: The navigation instruments indicate the position of the aircraft in relation to a selected navigation facility or fix. This group of instruments includes various types of course indicators, range indicators, glideslope indicators, and bearing pointers. _**HSI**_, _**Glide Slope, Localizer**_, etc.
