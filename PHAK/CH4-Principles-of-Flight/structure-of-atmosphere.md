## Structure of Atmosphere 

### Air is a Fluid:
- Both Liquids and Gasses (like the mix of gasses in the atmosphere)
- Fluids generally do not resist deformation when even the smallest stress is applied, or they resist it only slightly. We call this slight resistance viscosity. Fluids also have the ability to flow. Just as a liquid flows and fills a container, air will expand to fill the available volume of its container. 

### Viscosity 
- Viscosity is the property of a fluid that causes it to resist flowing. The way individual molecules of the fluid tend to adhere, or stick, to each other determines how much a fluid resists flow. _High-viscosity fluids are “thick” and resist flow; low-viscosity fluids are “thin” and flow easily. Air has a low viscosity and flows easily._
- A great illustration of viscosity is two ramps of the same material, oil poured down one ramp and water down the other. The oil will flow much more slowly than the water.
- Although it's difficult to calculate the viscosity of air, it is viscous, because it is a fluid, so it does resist flow around any object to some extent. 

### Friction
- Another factor at work when a fluid flows over or around an object is called friction. Friction is the resistance that one surface or object encounters when moving over another. Friction exists between any two materials that contact each other.
- To illustrate with the 2 ramp analogy, this time we have 2 ramps of _different surfaces_ one is coarse and bumpy, the other is flat and smooth. The coarse and bumpy ramp will exhibit much more friction than the smooth flat surface. 
- Any surface, no matter how smooth it appears in the macroscopic, microscopically will be disparate molecules and structures and will exert friction on any fluid flowing across them. 
- **Wing Friction Effects**: Molecules of air pass over the surface of the wing and actually adhere (stick, or cling) to the surface because of friction. Air molecules near the surface of the wing resist motion and have a relative velocity near zero. The roughness of the surface impedes their motion. The layer of molecules that adhere to the wing surface is referred to as the _boundary layer_. 
- **Wing Friction + Air Viscosity Drag**: Once the boundary layer of the air adheres to the wing by friction, further resistance to the airflow is caused by the viscosity, the tendency of the air to stick to itself. When these two forces act together to resist airflow over a wing, it is called _drag_.
