## Aviation Instruction (Fundamentals of Instruction) - Lessons / Notes

### Lessons and Notes from the [Aviation Instructors Handbook (FAA-H-8083-9B)](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/aviation_instructors_handbook)

### Note On This Repositories Content & Structure
- The FAA is clearly, and for very good cause over-stressing the importance of Aeronautical Decision Making, Cockpit Resource Management, and the 'soft skills' surrounding piloting and making good, safe decsions in the plane. To this end, they _repeat_ (and actually go into even more depth) the ADM and CRM/SRM chapters found in the 
[Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge (PHAK)](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/phak) at the start of this Aviation Instructors Handbook. So in the interest of time and to not duplicate to many concepts, I'll only briefly touch on some of the ADM/CRM/SRM concepts in the AIH and then quickly move on to the fundamentals of instruction (FOI) subjects like human behavior, learning, instruction, etc.
